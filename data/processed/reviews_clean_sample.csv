18847,303427,5,outstanding i look forward to trying some of the other topping combinations you listed but this time i used pillsbury s mint fudge brownie mix for a base and mixed in some tollhouse swirled chocolate chips after baking about 10 14 mins my mix was set for an 8x8 pan so it was a little thinner and i wanted to sure it stayed soft because of that modification i sprinkled the top with additional swirled chocolate chips and the mint chocolate frosting glaze that came inside the brownie mix we used a regular pizza cutter to divide our brownie slices and served it with vanilla ice cream it was so i especially loved the thinness when using that rich chocolate mint mix it was truly divine and allowed us to eat a huge slice without feeling guilty or overly full this is so versatile and and i will have fun playing around with the topping choices again you,855
29679,197151,1,i know this has a lot of very positive reviews and i don 039 t like to be difficult but i honestly didn 039 t like it i didn 039 t like the bottom peanut butter portion it didn 039 t have the peanut butter taste i was expecting i probably would have let my own opinion slide but when my 8 year old and 6 year old wouldn 039 t eat them and they are not picky eaters i thought i should probably mention it,403

141488,1531249,5,these are fabulous cookies i added a teaspoon of vanilla and decreased the cream of tartar slightly i found it easiest to scoop the cookie balls onto one big sheet then let them firm up in the fridge before rolling and sugaring them this is going into my file immediately,271
41959,63961,4,these are really i added a garlic clove to the mushroom mixture when it saut ed i also added about a half cup of mozzarella cheese and then topped it with a little cheese as well at the parsley and paprika here s a tip use a melon ball er to scoop out the mushrooms next time i am going to try it with feta cheese like dotm did,327

316715,74342,4,not a bad bisquick i did not have the listed pan size so i used a 9 inch square pan the brownies seemed to take longer to bake but turned out a little overdone on the edges i personally didn t care for the unmelted chocolate chips in the batter it was a little too chocolatey for me and i will add chopped nuts next time instead,328
87782,45058,5,this was perfect with our roasted leg of lamb everyone loved them and there was none left will be making these potatoes alot,124

28240,250559,5,this is a fantastic taco seasoning mix i substituted homemade chili powder for bought to reduce the sodium greatly for this is 38558 by dee514 for all the flavor,161
324853,959246,5,ingredients a breeze to prepare and very very it s up there with shrimp scampi but much faster to prepare and lighter can be at a moment s notice,145
413505,831580,4,this was a decent drink i don t drink much nowadays but i have a bottle of myers s dark rum to use up so i found this for decades i thought of kern s being the peach nectar gold standard but i couldn t find it where i live now however i did manage to find the imported jumex brand i the exactly as written except that i don t have a proper highball glass and used a tall drinking glass instead the taste is pretty for a warm afternoon beverage and i ve already this several times,479

277678,130531,5,molly this tonight for dinner i poached the chicken in broth yesterday cooled it and refrigerated until tonight i did let it come to room temperature before frying tho that it so just the batter and fry i did have a problem with the batter being too stiff and added almost a cup more milk it was much thinner and fried just perfectly it doesn t take long at all since the meat is done and the batter fries up crispy and golden in a short time i think i could have added even more pepper but will do that next time we all enjoyed this and i am anxious to try it cold tomorrow love it that way too for a new way of fixing perfectly cooked chicken donna,650
197209,364980,5,this was so served with saffron rice amp green beans i was so anxious to get it in my mouth that i forgot to take pictures but it was beautiful i also did not add the cornstarch,177
80190,94087,5,a very way to cook fish dale i chose salmon fillets and although i didn t change the ingredients in any way i did cook the salmon in a pan with a lid on the cooktop instead of on the bbq grill it took 16 mins on med heat as salmon is quite thick for a lovely dale,263
87354,851146,5,yum these meatballs were i m addicted to cumin at the moment so i added a wee bit more to the sauce along with extra chilli some diced onion throughout i used fresh coriander instead of parsley as well it was fantastic i rec 35076 yeast rolls with a garlic butter topping to soak up the sauce both recipes seemed to blend perfectly time wise i m already trying to work out how soon we can have it again without hubi noticing my repetitiveness find,447
455574,2002014172,3,everything went so smoothly and it looked so pretty like real authentic gumbo and then thyme all i can taste is thyme definitely need to tweak the spices but this is a really starting point and very to follow,208
130384,535912,1,i could not fit all the ingredients in the jar and the cookie dough was dry,75
16576,22038,5,it s tops in my book to fix and delicous i m on a low sodium diet and so i used honey mustard olive oil instead of margine and unsalted matzo meal instead of bread crumbs it came out and i plan to it often,205
27208,669694,5,i used this with stew meat instead of a roast and then boiled egg noodles and stirred those into the stew meat in the crock pot before serving i did add additional water about 1 2 way through the cooking time my family really enjoyed this the flavor and meat texture were outstanding i used mixes with the lowest sodium contents that i could find and my family said they didn t think it was too salty the mixes at my grocery store that i discovered had the lowest sodium were mccormick zesty italian dressing mix mccormick home style gravy mix and the hidden valley ranch original salad dressing and seasoning mix for a idea yooper,631
204570,314086,5,but even better if it is marmite on vogels bread with thickly sliced avocado yummm,82
215827,137838,5,love this used it on green salads with nuts and fruits also tastes with a bit of feta,85
231036,479050,5,perfect banana bread i added a handful of dried cranberries along with walnuts i will definitely this again,107
351610,2000375668,5,fab refreshing concoction and far less cloying than cola on its own try a sliced kiwi instead of the lemon for a slightly different variation i 039 m also mulling over the addition of a splash of vodka lol one thing i 039 ve not figured out though is that when presented abroad it comes out as a 039 layered 039 drink which is nicely visually dramatic my young son particularly appreciates it i 039 ve thus far failed to recreate this at home any thoughts macr macr,465
136026,310237,5,quiche i sauteed half an onion and some garlic and added that to the mixture it did take a bit longer than the time listed but totally worth the wait for posting,161
152211,2462950,4,i had this for dinner tonight and it was i used chicken thighs because it is what i had used cream of chicken soup with a splash of milk placed the chicken in covered with onions carrots celery and little pieces of potato i also did the dumplings but i used bisquick i think the key is that you have to turn the crockpot onto high when doing the dumplings your liquid should be boiling the bottom half of mine cooked but the tops were still gooey so i just flipped them over and let them cook for another 10 minutes and they came out perfect the entire family loved it and it was super best of all was just about finished when i came home from work love my crock,662
36401,282079,5,excellent point to note with my first time using avacados if they re turning brown don t use them you can tell the difference purchase more than one so you have that option use only the freshest ingredients i two batches one with habaneros and lots of chillis hot sauce and onions the other exactly as above i find the cilantro really authenticates the mexican flare,366
439887,1414716,3,the sauce gave me trouble i didn 039 t like it raw at all i threw it in a pot and doctored it like a curry turmeric onion powder cumin in the end i cooked the quinoa in stock with sauteed onions zucchini and garlic the final dish worked out on fairly well lt br gt lt br gt i loved blending the zucchini and onion with the coconut milk the blending is a idea the sauce was beautifully thick and green i just think that this is the beginning of a sauce not something complete,474
442807,2668811,4,the texture is perfect the ingredients are perfect for my strict diet no sugar gluten soy dairy or corn for posting i can t wait to try your pecan pie,150
195609,1112314,4,this soup is very unfortunately krab fake crab unravels when warm i had to strain it out after eating the first bowl 039 s worth this would obviously taste a million times better with real crab i was just trying to cut down on my seafood consumption i will try again with beef broth and beef strips to mix things up either way the broth was very and i loved the heat,366
48144,429104,5,would you believe i couldn t find any steakums in the superfresh what kind of self respecting supermarket doesn t stock steakums i picked what turned out to be a tough cut of meat i ll use a better cut next time or i ll go to a different store and get the steakums i used some crumbles i had left in the fridge in lieu of the american cheese and i added a handful of halved cherry tomatoes the tomatoes went in when the pasta did we enjoyed this in spite of my poor beef judgement,480
280184,2001933446,5,omg so the two of us ate them all i had a few pieces of bacon left and some eggs and ive never a souffl eacute but googled it and got this it was very thick like dough and i thought i did it wrong but when i added the eggs it loosened up it says bring to a boil but its weird to boil dough either way i followed the directions and it came out killer my gf said it was fluffy and but recommended adding jalapenos i thought it would be with spinach i will try the variations in the future and fun,494
1103,52074,5,marg these were as my ds described i didn t use the nuts because i was making these specifically for my son and he s not into nuts in his took a pic while they were baking and asked kathy to leave your pic as the default because yours is more appealing anyway and my son said i must these for his cousins when they come over christmas also he demanded i them to look like your picture snowflakes and all marg i thought i could get away without drizzling the white chocolate on the top but the ds knows how to look up recipes here and saw the pic you took again for posting,572
168890,607558,5,excellent i used a salmon filet because that is what i had it still came out beautifully so quick and this is a keeper i have this many times since my first review and it is becoming my favorite i give my husband a choice and he always chooses this one kittencal for such a i always use your first if i have a choice,316
40631,424494,4,it was pretty maybe i should have let it bake longer so the tortillas would not have been so soggy in general everyone finished their plate and even ate the leftovers for lunch,176
43186,146783,5,we really enjoyed this roast it is very and was a excuse to use up bbq sauce in my fridge we froze 4 bags for use later in our freezer as well the only change i was that i added additional bbq sauce as i had so much pork for sharing,232
2708,302283,5,this was the best guacamole we ve ever had you for the we ll be making it again and again,89
165606,137428,3,loved the flavor i used the orange extract but my gumdrops turned cloudy and grainy and were really hard also i couldn t get them out of the pan they seemed fine until step 6 it seems to me that i should have added the flavor and color to the pot instead of trying to mix it in the shallow layer of the 8x8 dish but maybe the cooking time was off for my altitude i know candy is picky about cooking times and methods greased pans and a candy thermometer might just have fixed all my problems if i knew what temperature to cook the candy to,539
62013,111964,5,my entire family loved this i had to double the and i used penne pasta instead but it was absolutely wonderful,110
29598,1496945,5,this is my go to for all and any grilled breasts moist and tender cooked on weber grill using indirect heat from the sides with chicken in the middle with drip pan nothing it kept grill temp between 400 425 degrees for a fast cook 6 8oz breasts 20 min per side delish needs another 5 stars you p s use a submersible blinder and it a salad dressing also,352
390416,95685,5,i tried this for the first time tonight following the as stated except for the last step of slathering bbq sauce on the ribs on the grill the thought of leaving a messy grill along with the prospect of burnt ribs deterred me i found it better for me to dip my ribs in the sauce after they were cooked plus i got the benefit of the true flavor which i must say was absolutely wonderful not to mention the ribs were falling off the bone this will be added to my favorites to be over and over again,495
20374,198601,5,very i used for valentines day presents cut the recipie in half but then needed to add another 1 2 cup of flour enjoy,117
131864,1800364735,5,i lost my and was so thrilled to find this one it is exactly like my everyone is so thrilled with these cookies they are the best,129
204069,451042,5,finally fantastic fajitas the marinade blend causes the meat to almost caramelize on the grill i used sirloin steaks and marinated them for an hour i did not spoon any reserved marinade on at the end personal preference i grilled the steaks on high heat and seared both sides i let them rest in a foil tent while i grilled the onion and peppers sliced the steaks mixed them with the veggies and served them with cheese sour cream avocado and tortillas wrapped in foil and warmed in a 300 degree oven makes lots of leftovers that are even better the next day i also served them with a side of mexican rice you,608
205890,2001617036,3,i found them to be too sweet and difficult to bake into a solid cookie so i changed it a bit i used coconut oil instead of butter and put the dough in the fridge for awhile have you tried that peanut butter with coconut it s if you don t care for the taste you could use refined oil or half virgin half refined i rolled the dough in almond meal instead of sugar for me this a better cookie,389
284430,2001138648,5,i chose to use four cheese alfredo instead of the condensed soup i used havarti cheese and both mushrooms and onions omg this is not cheesy decedent served it over white rice and it is a huge hit,195
41788,93911,5,finally got these correctly turns out you do have use regular butter they are,77
288059,652936,5,loved it added about 1 3 tsp thyme when i added the asparagus tops i ll it again and again,90
254395,2002368953,5,i used this yesterday and it was my first time ever attempting to cheese filled pierogi i was raised on leniwe as our holiday tradition these turned out to be absolutely perfect after reading the reviews i followed the advice of adding water to dough to get it to the right consistency after mixing it all together everything that followed was rolling filling pressing the edges together sometimes i saw that they were coming apart before i put into water so i just pressed harder or wet the edge with my finger to get them to stay each one turned out beautiful i was so excited about this i shared with my mom she s 84 and she s going to them too,647
54230,539977,4,4 out of 5 people really liked this at our house i used 1 ground chicken and only 1 can of chilies i didn t have cayenne so i used chili powder i did not use the salt as there was enough in the broth i used 5 cloves of garlic minced instead of the powder this was really for the baby and not firehouse chili you,311
140213,282079,2,after reading all the other rave reviews i feel a little bad giving this only 2 stars but we felt it was pretty bland even after adding a hot pepper it also was very pasty sure you add water broth before adding the pasta i didn t and the pasta seemed to soak up the liquid instead of the sauce,293
403559,1052065,5,perfect filling for my 404510 this was super and creamy with the right amount of sweetness with the tang for sharing librachick93093,132
38298,565973,5,this is fabulous my family really enjoyed it i used about 5 medium yukon gold potatos thats what i had on hand 6 slices of bacon as recommended by another reviewer other then those 2 small changes i followed this to a t it came out perfect this is about 6 bowl size servings so you will have plenty this is a soup and is very hearty we will be making this again for sure for a wonderful,386
221953,258528,5,quick and to prepare taste will it again,40
191318,531163,5,really really really maybe more spice next time had company over and it was loved by all,88
116803,203823,5,this is excellent very flavorful i did not have any ground turkey so i used only lean ground pork and i had no fennel seeds either for the wine i used a peppery shiraz and the flavor is excellent you,199
224732,2001847749,4,i like the idea of putting some hidden vegetables in my mac n cheese so i thought i d try this the sauce was really bland with only 4 6 ounces of cheese i increased the shredded cheddar to about 2 cups and added 1 5 teaspoons of coarse sea salt that really helped bring out the flavor i didn t have mustard powder so i substituted 1 tablespoon of yellow mustard i also wanted to add a little kick to this dish so i put a layer of sliced pepper jack cheese between the vegetables and the top layer of macaroni it wasn t overpowering only used 2 slices of cheese and it gave a little quot surprise quot to the flavor i found this very labor intensive took 45 mins to prep it for the oven and dirtied at least 4 pans i like the idea but i think i d use leftover vegetables next time precooked and i don t think you need to cook the scallions and tomato the baking should soften them enough i baked it 30 mins then turned off the oven and let it sit inside for 15 mins came out perfect looks and tastes three adults ate only half the pan so i think it could feed 6 and we went back for seconds,1089
367036,2001798479,2,i m not a cook so i know the problem was mine but not sure what i did wrong the outside was too hard and the inside was dense did i leave it in too long,152
162379,320577,5,this is one of the fastest and best recipes for general tso s chicken i added an extra chicken breast since we needed 5 servings and a little extra garlic but the still makes more than enough sauce this is my husbands favorite and couldn t believe it was a ww,259
3470,79180,4,this isn t a pretty finished product so you wont be serving it to impress anyone but it tastes soooooo perfect comfort dh said what s that it looks weird then had seconds,170
71728,313633,5,my family loved it for posting,30
264672,1001335,5,i have used this several times the brine i don t smoke the turkey i just rinse the turkey and cook as usual i ve given this to several people and this is the only way they do their turkey now,191
414842,915292,2,i just this from ellie s book and was very disappointed so much so that instead of trying to eat it as is i used the whole batch in a bread it s rising now,155
54357,401652,5,wonderful i had some rather hard old homemade bread and didn t want to throw it away this was a perfect way to use it up and fast too,133
43990,961542,5,deeeeeeeeeelicious we loved this pie,36
259393,2001966112,5,this is the bomb dot com all of that i don t cook because most recipes are a disaster or the serving size is too big or it takes too long i m cooking for one and i don t want to slave over a hot stove all day for one sometimes its just not worth it but this was to reduce prepare and cook and devour satisfied my craving for beef tips and rice locked in my memory now to find a man to cook for lol,397
74554,549563,5,i the pear version and i really liked it i ate it without ice cream but added it for my friends who loved it,108
61081,539781,5,i add a dash of vanilla but otherwise leave these alone everyone loves them and i ve already given the out to a few people they can also be cooked on a grill in case anyone wanted to know but up the cooking time my future fil doesn t like baking because the oven makes the house hot so he offered to supervise them on the grill,327
44888,349071,5,wonderfully deceptively wings served some with pan fried potatos with garlic and red onion the rest have been flying out in the lunch box,137
217683,965108,5,you soooooooooooooooooooo much very,35
35775,310518,3,this is an to and filling dish i put all the ingredients together in the morning immediately before baking it i chose cooked crumbled breakfast sausage and the only change i was using melted butter since i don t keep margarine on hand we were a little disappointed when the hash brown potatoes were soggy and didn t have much flavor overall it was enough with more salt and served with salsa since there was just two of us i cut the remaining casserole into 3 inch squares and put them in baggies and froze them when we wanted a couple for breakfast we thawed them in the fridge overnight and in the morning put them into a non stick skillet with some oil over a medium high to high flame and browned the bottom turned the heat down put a lid on the pan to heat the squares through and melt the cheese that worked well for posting,830
46777,48107,3,i wouldn t have called something that takes almost an hour a rush up to be in a hurry but i had the time so i tried it definitely and not bad but nothing that impressed me much i added some crushed red pepper some garlic and onion to give it some flavour since as written it was awfully bland unfortunately this one didn t really do it for us sorry,348
180431,2001224194,5,this was fantastic i have always steamed shrimp and i recently came back from the outer banks i have eaten at dirty dicks an pops in avon always wondered how they got it so and not dry or mushy i would do this again and the wife agrees,235
178749,324629,4,i grew up with this cake but if you can get the unamericanized version i think it is much better,96
283282,2002273886,3,while this was i m giving it three stars because this has some issues i halved most of the ingredients and still came out with a 9x13 pan full of which could easily feed 4 5 people i m not sure how you could get the full in a pan and you d also be feeding an army the other problem was with the custard sauce i ve never a white sauce before so i needed way more guidance than the suggests i tried halving it but the sauce would not be anything other than pure liquid i another batch and just utterly winged it adding more flour and less milk the end result was edible in the future i will find another pastitsio and copy their custard sauce instead this is very filling and full of protein a lot of work though i needed four pans on the stove just a warning,757
30954,225620,5,i thought this was fantastic i cut the in half and used only the egg white i also added some cinnamon as recommended by other reviewers i will be making this again,163
326490,2867615,5,this warmed me up on this dreary sunday morning and it is and quick next time i will cut back on the splenda a bit just personal preference i don t often drink plain milk and hot cocoa is a way for me to increase my intake and to use up the milk and get the health benefits of cocoa,282
385126,2001994320,5,i had to laugh at how ridiculously this was and it was perfect all those years chasing recipes that take hours lol,114
43543,843372,5,these were the perfect addition to my cookie trays for christmas we always love these and they are always asked for so i added them to my trays this year all ages love these cookies and they will be enjoyed,206
135649,185466,5,i can t believe i haven t reviewed this yet during the winter i this twice a month and with just my boyfriend and i i can have left overs for lunch whenever i want i love it it s and super,188
203062,2745067,5,now i 039 m a fussy lover coming from a history of top cooks in 5 star hotel ones so i rate my taste buds as above average this was my first attempt at doughnuts and everyone who tasted them raved no jokes like aawww so please me a whole lot etc they froze and reheated excellently i noticed when fresh ie same time cooked they have a distinguished sour taste but after freezing and reheating this sour taste goes away possibly the yeast needs to die so much i got 40 small doughnuts from one mix i have these twice now plain icing sugar straight from the packet for coating is a hit with my 5yr old daughter,608
168780,174711,5,there is nothing like this for tsatziki nothing i just use it as it is when finished it s thinner than commercial but tastes so much better ev,142
54225,92758,5,excellent brownies not sure what the previous reviewer meant by oily taste we didn t get that at all they were ooey and gooey and chocolatey my 2 year old daughter said mmm mmm mmm mmm mmmmmmmm,193
19259,87819,5,my husband said these are incredible the flavor just explodes obviously a big hit at our thanksgiving meal i doubled the amount of garlic and i cooked the potatoes and garlic in two cans of chicken broth plus enough water to cover and since it was thanksgiving i used lots of butter these were creamy and,304
235913,388651,5,i these this week very to i did add some finely chopped pecans other than that i followed the we really enjoyed them this is more like a shortbread cookie which i was looking for i will these again oh i used european style butter which has a higher butterfat content,266
55360,42586,5,this was i added a little granulated garlic and dried basil with the dry ingredients i set the machine for the dough cycle and then baked in the oven for the wonderful i ll be making this often,193
339668,632657,4,we really enjoyed this dish i misplaced my bottle of clam juice so i used some chicken broth and i used all but about 1 cup of the milk mixture i like a thicker chowder i cooked it on low in my slow cooker for about 4 hours and served it along side a loaf of beer bread mmmmmm i this for belly warmers soups stews for sharing this,330
238800,430117,5,had this for dessert tonight taste,34
180632,1773989,5,every time i this i get rave reviews the is very versatile as others have noted we usually have fresh dungeness crab on christmas eve so on christmas morning i this with leftover crab sauteed in the eggs along with peppers garlic onions and fresh thyme and beautiful,266
36486,35112,5,i did it all this way but i forgot to put the milk on so i poured it on top of everything else turned out and i didn t have to press down it held everything together these are also with peanut butter chips or butterscotch chips in place of some of the others,258
36399,76559,4,darn i like the peppery flavour along with the basil i am not sure if i could have served 6 with this amount but maybe we re big eaters i served 4 happily with whole wheat crackers on the side,192
297058,534447,5,peanut buttery goodness,23
16325,762694,5,this is reminds me of something i get at johnny carinos you could use chicken in place of shrimp too mushrooms would be a addition also i used white cooking wine in place of vermouth,182
316418,2001428627,5,this is a base i agree with many others it really needs more liquid i did 2 cups of broth and 1 cup of wine that seemed to do the trick,135
27144,191535,5,my son this and it is so we are very strict cake judges it is really,68
134574,965764,3,unlike the other reviewers i found that it had to be cooked covered for the barley to even remotely begin to absorb the water and juice it took closer to 2 hours to be done i also found the cider flavor to be a little too dominant and i reduced the amount used to 1 5 cups,272
306014,528617,5,i ve this salad twice the first with chicken for my meat eating friends and the second time vegan for my boyfriend for the vegan dish i added tempeh in the place of the chicken used vegannaise and did not add the cheese instead of using the celery i added a tablespoon of relish and that worked out wonderfully for both dishes this is a summer i also added some spices such as onion powder and garlic powder just to give some extra flavor very i will be making this again,471
246675,2000262553,4,just this because my son loves branston and as we are not going to the uk this year i can 039 t stock up on anything the taste is although not really like branston i 039 d say it tastes more like the stuff they used to sell in lidl a few years ago meanwhile they stock a different brand which i liked better anyway but it does not look anywhere near branston or other pickle as it is very light in color i don 039 t know if it will darken a bit while it is stored but right now it reminds me a bit of the apple jam i last summer i need to sure i label the jars properly the texture is different to branston and other pickle but that 039 s mainly because i did not want to spent hours chopping and dicing veggies i rather put everything in my thermomix it was to much to cook in there though but if my son likes it and i have to it again i will change the amount to it fit in my tm5,881
106611,2385874,5,this soup is so delicous home soup is so never buying canned soup again,71
152148,260882,5,these are they come together very quickly and taste wonderful i did sub semi sweet for the milk chocolate chips,111
93699,936998,4,i enjoyed this but my husband wasn t too crazy about it i added chili powder instead of paprika and didn t add in the salt,122
52282,787766,5,this is very very and to put together,37
131784,1286770,5,i ve been serving this salad for years and it s always a big hit i add cherry tomatoes and use bagged italian blend salad mix when in a real hurry you can substitute newman s own balsamic it tastes i also sprinkle fresh parmesan over the top a side is french bread spread with veggie cream cheese sprinkled with fresh parmesan and broiled until bubbly it s,356
79662,456116,5,what i thought would be an ok late breakfast turned out to be simply wonderful i followed the directions exactly and it worked perfectly the eggs stayed together and the yolks were i wasn t sure i would like the texture of the eggs which was holding me back from making a poached egg but these were so that i savored every bite for the anyone can loved it,355
43455,415212,5,your right joy the bread is outstanding and what i like is that its to put together and you usually have everything already in the pantry you dont have to go out and buy certain items i it today and hubby loved it as much as my kids,232
45809,379034,5,very taste medium spice sauce could be a bit thicker,52
18872,9225,5,this was so and quick to not to mention how wonderful it tasted don t over cook it or the chicken will get alittle dry 7 hours on low was just right serving over rice and noodles are both,187
5365,717898,4,my husband really loves this it was a treat,43
112833,19540,5,i have tried a lot of different minestrone recipes and this is probably the best of them all the fennel adds a little kick without overpowering and the flavors blend beautifully i used homemade turkey stock instead of beef and an italian chicken sausage also a red bell pepper instead of green fabulous comfort you so much for sharing it,337
80156,1721803,5,this helped me through my first gingerbread cookie attempt and even with the gluten free and vegan substitutions i pamela s gluten free baking mix for wheat flour earthbalance for butter and ener g egg replacer for the egg it was a definite winner perhaps it was the gluten free flour i was using but i had no problems with sticky dough even though i waited less than two hours to prepare the cookies the cookies came out soft with perfectly puffed edges and crisp golden bottoms,479
24041,465365,5,i ve this a couple of times now and it s become a family favorite i like to add a little garlic cumin and a tiny bit of liquid smoke for additional flavor it s a to stretch a small amount of chicken add a side dish or two and you can feed six easily for the,257
283691,1022279,5,my favorite for cooking pork chops in a crockpot i thought i had reviewed this but i guess i didn t sorry i have been making this for years the family loves it i have always followed the exactly and it turns out perfect every time for an,237

196044,49219,5,i 039 m a st louis native living overseas and this was just the remedy i needed to cure a touch of homesickness to speed up the breading process i put the flour the eggs and the breadcrumbs in the three separate tupperware containers with tight fitting lids i put the raviolis in the first container and shook vigorously then i repeated with the following containers in the suggested order worked like a charm i used the italian breadcrumbs 206196 and served the ravioli with homemade marinara sauce 39629 i will these again and again you so much for sharing,558
31526,33443,5,my grandfather this all the time for us when we were kids for posing an old favorite,84
306811,591894,5,this is an excellent gyro i put it in the cuisinart to mix it all up pressed it in a loaf pan and when it was done baking i drained it and put a brick wrapped in foil on top of it while it cooled idea from alton brown sliced it and fried it up they were,253
187415,705552,5,thick chewy slightly sweet very filling very deep dish style,60
113270,468007,4,these were were missing some spice to them but still very everyone that tried them liked them the first pan i i forgot to spray my tinfoil and they stuck pretty bad to it second batch i sprayed tinfoil with some pam and they came right up i would recommend this they were very to next time i ll add in some garlic powder or try some spicey sausage but i will again for the,372
32548,116518,5,this was a very a lot more work than my usual lasangna which consists of noodles meat sauce and mozzarella but well worth it my husband said it was the best lasagna he has every had and this is definitely a 5 star now that s an accomplishment for the,250
182512,2887514,5,it 039 s light doesn 039 t need any dressing oil avocado makes it so smooth refreshing lime juice works very well in combination with tomato do not want to add any ingredients t 039 s as it is lt br gt you for posting,217

42256,429815,5,mmmm these are so i used butter and a full cup of pecan halves and wow it was just the butterscotchy taste i was looking for,124
152948,2001190106,4,i followed your but instead of leaving it in the oven for 2 hours i left it in for 90 minutes it was medium well very juicy and tender wonderful bravo,150
67898,159532,5,most excellent just starting to get into the cook ahead thing this is perfect enough to eat and freeze very dh and picky child loved it,135
131393,988426,5,this is to assemble and very it is equally with shrimp or a combination of shrimp and crab,90
100804,77982,5,stuff it for a party and everyone liked the extra flavor i went back for 2nd s and it was already gone will definately it again and again,137
140416,30407,5,i can t believe i haven t reviewed this this in one of my go to recipes at the school i have many variations different kinds of fruit and they all turned out also used rice milk too i hope you don t mind but i am adding it to my work cookbook with credit to you so if i am not at work someone can these muffins for the kids,323
47077,851990,5,fabulous won t anything else used onion powder and dill relish,62
311986,82648,5,this was so and and the taste was wonderful the only thing i left out was the cream it tasted creamy and buttery without the cream or butter used olive oil,155
650,82994,4,i this for some neighbors who have a family member in the hospital and they really liked it i myself did not get to try it but they liked it and it was to and smelled while cooking,180
375947,401366,5,don be intimidated by the amount of ingredients in this it is really i cut the in half which it perfect for us it is a must try for posting,139
481224,1802406564,4,i had never cooked or eaten wahoo before was to follow but it would have helped to know what temperature to have the pan at as i just guessed fish turned out pretty but i was wishing for more flavor only caught a little bit of the citrus here and there,252
257400,326543,5,found this in a magazine years ago we love mangos and this is one of the best ways to use them this has been our christmas morning tradition for years i do reduce the sugar to 1 1 4 cup,185
93914,2001210506,5,this is the best chicken ever so to and to clean up best part us you don t have to quot babysit quot while it frying on the stove it all the time,145
25587,251414,5,do yourself a huge favor and double or triple this and freeze a portion for a rainy day this is an amazingly unbelievably stupendously dish,139
88486,165081,5,loved this i hail from kansas city where we know a thing or two about bbq these are some of the best pork ribs i ve had you so much,131
96467,64321,5,this soup was very i was a little afraid of the amount of cumin it sounded like a lot so i halved it truthfully it would have been better with the listed amount i also used two cans of black beans for a,202
190135,236992,5,this was the best tetrazzini i ve ever had very flavorable it was a very wintery meal and i will definitely this again you kittencal,132
494491,2000904463,5,as written used 1 4 tsp ground cayenne except i did not have sesame oil the entire family loved it from 2 40 a second side pan of sauce using lesser amounts of the peppers and adding some minced garlic we used that to drizzle on steamed broccoli fabulous and my favorite part fast will be sharing with my friends you,316
53914,40560,5,excellent i m a cook for the elks club and i served 60 people this dish and it seems almost everyone requested the goooood job r,128
632,30209,4,these were i followed the exactly the first time they muffins weren t quite sweet enough and i don t have a very big sweet tooth the second time i them i added a sprinkling of brown sugar on the top that was just the perfect amount of sweetness i love that they are healthy,273
136384,2019346,5,i absolutely love this too i half a batch by dividing the measurements in half except for eggs butter and salt i used 3 egg yolks 1 5 t butter and 1 t of salt i didn t have sage and yellow onions at the time instead i used terragon and 1 medium shallot it works i spent 4 5 years in germany and this spaetzle brings back happy memories a million rita d,352
231626,1222615,4,this was very however next time i plan on making the following changes instead of the cheddar i m going to use jack or pepper jack cheese because that is what i use in regular rellenos and the cheddar this taste a little off to us if i use regular jack cheese i probably will add an additional spice or two like cumin taco or mexican seasoning,343
310310,1053078,5,yum i love the texture of the edges,35
101251,437767,4,loved the flavor of these but had a really hard time keping them from crumbling will continue to try until perfected,116
196633,605252,5,supreme in all ways,19
10554,615117,5,very i loved the nutmeg i used a bit of fresh ground nutmeg the combination of the sweet carrots with the broccoli like kohlrabi was bergy always has recipes,157
17994,35729,5,very clean taste i used both shrimp and imitation crab i printed it out to place in my cookbook will certainly this again you,125
233481,2007846,5,i thought it was excellent i did not use as much garlic just two cloves and the flavor was just right i also added 2 sliced fresh portabella mushrooms and served it over pasta dish,180
310086,446297,5,oh my was this delish i thought it might be a little sweet but it just as written the sugar gave it such a brown crispy outside talk about tender wouldn t change a thing so much for sharing such a treat update this again and accidently added 1 4 cup of white vinegar i almost started over but figured i d run with it the result was extraordinary oh so tender will this mistake a regular addition,395
107997,52664,5,really and so i followed the as written and all the flavors were i was so excited to find another use for the montreal seasoning,128
22176,522192,5,this is a substitute when you don t have the time to a lasagna and it tastes just as my husband went back to several helpings so i knew it was a keeper i halved the and there was still enough for generous servings,213
373334,55910,5,very very stuff definately going to this again i m always looking to spice up plain old chops this was a and for posting,120
40056,588529,4,i wasn t crazy about this although my dad absolutely loved it i cut up the asparagus into 1 inch pieces as the other commenter recommended and while i loved the soft asparagus the bread sauce around it was a little too mushy for my liking i like the idea and will play around with this in the future,299
123857,224367,5,very and i just added some curry leaves to it to it even more aromatic i love your recipes you for sharing,106
16887,2001213758,5,this is the best i have ever i did not add or take away anything will be making these again and again,101
49769,186086,5,very old fashioned custard type pie i added an extra egg and alittle extra buttermilk because my pie dish was extra deep photo submitted and it turned out perfect i also added alittle watkins lemon extract for extra flavor it was a big hit at our pot luck and i also want to ad i did get to bring some home from that potluck leftover and overnight in the fridge the flavors and texture of the pie intensified and was even better next time i this pie i will it a day early and refridgerate it over night wonderful yum,516
195809,486888,4,it was but not wow worked for a quick meal to though a shortcut could be to buy pre chopped veggies it d be to add a bit more flavor to it maybe sharp cheddar chili pepper or something i let the veggies cook closer to 10 min because i like them softer lots and lots so there s some for tomorrow for sharing,306
70165,933008,5,we loved this pizza dough we will use it often,46
29937,47723,4,my wife requested mac and cheese with ham for her birthday dinner so i found this i loved it unfortunately she didn 039 t she didn 039 t like the flavor the gravy imparted to the dish or i would have given it 5 stars i used regular kraft mac and cheese and doubled the but i omitted the onion as my wife is allergic,315
18995,1107968,5,i would like to the gal that so generously shared her grandma 039 s with us these biscuits are absolutely the best sourdough biscuits i 039 ve ever had you lt br gt they mix up in just a matter of minutes and are beautiful when they come out of the oven lt br gt side note they just passed the quot husband test quot flying colors,330
63068,1897589,5,this crust is a keeper for sure and never buying in store again i added a few drops of orange flavoring since the filling was going to be dark chocolate fudge and now my boyfriend just won t share you for the,208
135264,236556,5,this is very and very my dh loved them i used whole peppers as that is the way my momma used to fix them and adjusted the cooking time from the original 30 minutes to a couple of hours and they turned out wonderful to both of the chefs that contributed to making this a very dish,279
351706,125411,4,the flavor of this is absolutely outstanding it s lighter and healthier but you won t feel like you re eating diet i did have some trouble with the dumplings i followed the directions exactly but it was almost as if they wouldn t fully cook although i let them boil away for over 20 minutes very mushy that probably has a lot more to do with my dumpling expertise than the i m going to try it again and if i can get the dumplings right this will be a five star for us so much for posting,487
78337,755285,5,this was excellent it was a lot of fun to because it s not your traditional i added a 1 4 teaspoon of allspice with the other spices also it baked in 45 minutes keep an eye on it because it will brown up pretty fast a tall cake and very moist my family loved it,261
46262,573418,5,i dry brined my 12 lb turkey overnight in the refrigerator rinsed off the excess salt and poured the boiling water over as instructed it was cool to watch the skin shrink up i had to resist the urge to roam the neighborhood offering to quot shrink wrap quot turkeys for other families i slathered the bird with butter and a season blend and baked as instructed the results were spectacular juicy flavorful turkey with a crisp skin will this my go to method from now on,468
59224,1396309,5,i have been looking for a shredded beef and i have now found the perfect one i used a larger can of green chile and instead of chipote peppers which upset my tummy i found a new product it s in the hispanic section of our grocery store and it s like chipolte boullion cubes it gave a flavor without all the mess i browned my roast then threw it in the crock pot put my onions and garlic in the skillet i browned my roast in cooked them until soft added the other ingredients and threw it all in the crock after 3 hours on high i pulled out the roast shredded it and put it back in for about an hour so it would absorb more flavor i served this with fresh tomatoes cilantro onions and queso fresco with corn and flour tortillas it wasn t too hot and my 3 year old liked it too super splendid and will over and over again,819
434121,2001549724,2,i really like lydia s show but this is flawed 1 cup of breadcrumbs for 1lb of meat is far too much it makes really gummy textured dense meatballs also the addition of 2 3 cup of parmesan the sauce really heavy i like to add garlic and herbs to my sauce but that may be a personal taste thing i would urge lydia to revisit this and maybe some changes having said that there are still many of her recipes that i am anxious to try,427
40500,308200,5,i this cake for a friends birthday party on 10 14 06 she loves spice cake i added a cup of apple butter and a cup of chunky cinnamon apple sauce to it instead of the cut up apples it was sooo everyone absolutely loved it even the kids the glaze on top was also i extra glaze and put half into the center of the batter before baking it kind of gave it a swirly crunchy cinnamon center,383
61592,1039398,5,this was very very i noted in a previous review that it was salty which would sense given the fact that you are using condensed soup and seasoned stuffing cubes what i had done was use unseasoned unsalted cubes be careful some labeled unseasoned still contains a lot of salt and i used low sodium cream of chicken soup when preparing the stuffing i didn t add any salt as there was plenty in the soup came out perfectly seasoned i might add peas next time outstanding,467
264394,679178,2,i this cake and the directions were really not very and i had to guess about a lot of it like when and what to do with the hot water where the mints went it turned out very but next time i will use a box mix and bought icing but i will the filling it was,254
3596,39311,5,this is a basic potato soup but it is so and just the way i want potato soup to be will be making it often exactly as said and wouldn 039 t change a thing,154
39087,1377125,5,thankyou lorac for sharing such a wonderful you ve convinced me to join recipezaar just to leave a review for this i didnt have any heavy whipping cream and subsituted the water and butter for it instead and it turned out so if anyone s missing the heavy whipping cream you can use the subsitute it really works,311
102501,152976,5,ugh i wrote a big long glowing review of this and then the website asked for my email address and password i entered them and then got a blank form so i don t think it submitted i ll have to give the short version this time 1 this is the caramels have flavor color and texture this is a huge improvement over the very touchy i ve used in the past 2 245 degrees is fine for cut caramels they are hard to cut but hold their shape and are pretty and i think for caramels it came out a bit too hard i ll back off by 5 10 degrees next time my candy thermometer doesn t have firm ball but i think i ll stop near soft ball 3 attention turtle novices don t them on wax paper i could ve cried them on a buttered plate or cookie sheet and i think after a short stay in the freezer they ll pop right off i had to tear the wax paper and iron the individual turtles to get them off it worked but was a lot of unnecessary pain to fix the problem 4 this is a for sharing i will add it to my stash of favorites,994
18230,57058,4,excellent dish the only change i is to replace water with chicken broth as it adds flavor otherwise,99
302120,680724,5,hubby and i really enjoyed this i it exactly as described using the tomato paste i am not a huge fan of thyme but it works so nicely in this dish next time i may halve the amount though only to meet my specific taste and like dewdropdeb i think i ll try it with ketchup you for sharing such a i an entire dish for just me and the hubby and we only had enough left to freeze two portions which we prompty reheated a few days later it s a keeper,443
57836,894377,5,my aunt makes these and they are i have had saved for a long time you so much for posting,89
30567,122782,4,and to i thinned it out with the extra milk if you don t it will be too thick as expected a fiance very very happy used over cauliflower and asparagus,150
257042,617721,4,would be to know what temp to bake the cookies on,49
43396,116137,5,yum these were so to and incredibly addictive we used chicken sausage and topped the mushrooms with bread crumbs mixed with melted butter instead of brushing with butter they came together quick and i love how you can adapt them to your tastes they are even cold that is if there are any left a for a keeper,307
62661,158704,5,this is sooooooooo my whole family cries for it gave it for gifts for christmas and i was queen,95
15169,104082,5,i doubled this and was able to 24 large sized muffins i lowered the heat to 350 degrees and cooked them for about 20 minutes upon removal from the oven i dipped them into the melted margarine and then the sugar cinnamon mixture very moist with a apple flavour,259
269324,371785,4,this is a from america s test kitchen they double it with a yield of 12 but i only got 10 out of it first ever that really comes out like a biscuit,147
80448,81695,3,this was a very moist cake however i feel that it was more of a cinnamon cake than a vanilla cake i was expecting a rich vanilla taste and it tasted like just cinnamon i think the chocolate version is so because there is just a hint of cinnamon,244
288988,753686,5,this is an outstanding soup my whole family loved it there is one change i i omitted the cauliflower i cooked it both ways and we all liked the soup better without the cauli flower ancho3,187
179427,337957,5,these were wonderful my 4 year old said she did like them when i put it on her plate i her try it anyway after a couple of bites she said oh yeah i forgot i like these this is a keeper,184
42094,1165615,3,this sauce was way to bland for our taste it has a consistency but was lacking flavor,85
196398,1414869,3,i crab rangoons all the time i usually deep fry but this is healthier some suggestions though you should egg wash the wantons on each side also add worschester not to much just a dash or two honestly the mayo is not necessary just the cream cheese,247
484232,1803597663,4,very flavorful two things i wonder what i did wrong sauce wasn 039 t as red as i expected nor it wasn 039 t as thick as i hoped for otherwise tastes pretty darn close to whole foods version,189
413493,214034,5,this is a way to it wish i knew this method before i put condensed milk in the pot forgot about it and went to bed i woke up with big bang no kidding water boiled out and condensed milk can projected itself to the ceiling leaving half moon mark in my ceiling then it exploded all over the kitchen ceiling walls cupboards everything yap sweet dreams at least i was not there when it exploded and i just started to date my husband who witness my cooking abilities it took few days to wash it all out when i write that i put can in the pot i mean that i used stove top and not a slow cooker slow cooker is safe way to this,619
32190,92264,5,perfect the cake is quite enough on its own and can easily do without the icing it s that rich and moist i ll be making this spanish bar often just to have it available for unexpected guests on special occasions i ll the icing which is just too,244
229072,2002219182,5,i ve been making virginia s lasagna for at least 20 years i it for my bunko group and they won t let me anything else i serve with roasted garlic salad and french bread delicioso,178
41419,1957858,5,have often on grill and in oven at 400 degrees for 1 hour i cut into 3 inch chunks put into individual packets i add onion slice sometimes ty for putting here,158
22342,33443,5,this was scrumptious and very to blackened peppers on grill as well cooked asparagus and zucchini on grill also used basil mint and coriander threw in some roasted chopped cashews and chopped mandarin oranges will definetely again as there can be sooo many things you can throw into this,287
15477,392520,2,this yielded 36 cookies i purposively divided the dough before refrigerating to be sure the dough dividing process would work out i flattened them out 6 at a time while keeping remaining dough in fridge to sure they were not going to explode out of the dough i was careful to seal them up the cookie is okay but i expected it would be better especially with the time put into them and the fact that they had snickers for posting the though,439
224448,2344891,5,absolutely superb i can t believe how light and fluffy it was my first attempt at a gluten free cake had that undercooked doughy appearance but not this one i m going to try using it as the basis for my regular flour chocolate orange zucchini cake and see how it turns out as someone 1 week into the gluten free journey i am really encouraged by the success of this you,369
41168,1263239,5,perfect i added a little diced green chili and garlic and we couldn t get enough way to jazz up ordinary and plain boring refried beans for sharing,147
3386,563726,5,i this last night and it was absolutely perfect such comfort and really i cooked for a total of two hours and the meat was so tender i changed nothing except the addition of fresh green beans and i used about a 1 2 cup of cabernet to deglaze yum,245
486261,2212854,5,can t say enough amazingly exactly as posted,44
26191,153824,5,i have been using this stuff faithfully for over a year now i think it works better than any store brand all purpose cleaner by far i even keep a handy refill container under the sink so i always have it when i need it you,222
329277,804978,5,i added some finely chopped nuts to the cinnamon filling and let me tell you they were out of this world what an breakfast snack,128
10819,356859,5,this was a fast that was absolutely for sharing,47
193235,1335842,5,i still have my card from the mail this is a chicken,52
22166,598608,4,pretty darn dish i improvised on the apple juice using apple sauce instead because i had no juice also i left out caraway seeds as i don t like them,148
19090,225096,5,i really like this as is it is for most people if seven a crowd a few ingredients to prep and can be served in a number of ways i zest my limes since it s available and extra flavor i ve added grated fresh ginger garlic paste or minced and red pepper flakes for different flavor combos tenders threaded on skewers then marinated and grilled are salad topper lunch wraps spring rolls and i even put it on a pizza with pineapple as is and always in my rotation,458
13982,346353,5,i marinated this for a few hours today and it on the grill this evening can you say dee lish ous the marinade was not too sweet i used a scant less than the 1 3 cup soy sauce and filled the rest with water as i was afraid it would be too soy saucey i also used pomegranite juice instead of the orange juice and freshly grated ginger it was phenomenal you for sharing such a wonderful,383
149547,421532,5,fantastic as usual,18
211485,713097,1,i tried this for dinner last night and was very disappointed my family eats chicken pretty regularly so i 039 m always looking for new ways to prepare it nobody liked this even a little,185
435042,1982632,5,these are very and i them for brunch and everyone thought they were especially that they were from scratch i will definitely these again,136
122334,866052,5,don t be afraid to substitute with what you have on hand in this for instance i didn t have enough honey so i added a bit of corn syrup and molasses i used 2 3 cups of all purpose flour along with 2 3 cup whole wheat flour i substituted golden raisins for apricots you get the idea these cookies still came out delish rave reviews from my hubby and kid and you have to admit they are very for you,396
203824,905182,5,i was making a test run on this before i ground beef gyros tomorrow and wow these are and perfect my dh just stole two to go with humus i will probably have to a second batch for the gyros tomorrow i know my kids will eat them once they are home from school for sharing this is definitely a keeper the only thing i did differently was used my bread machine like another reviewer did and it really this,401
339453,2001268850,5,well i can tell you i just finished our 14 pound turkey and it turned out absolutely perfect our local store sold this brand http www honeysucklewhite com products fresh whole turkey which was already prepared in brine so i dont know if that a difference i am so glad your website recommended checking bird temp 1 hour before the recommended butterball conversion because based on that conversion website a 14lb bird was to take 3 to 3 5 hours ours was done in just under 2 hours goodness i checked it i am also glad you stated to not add water etc we have plenty of basting juice that came from just the turkey fat etc for making our thanksgiving perfect,655
305464,1734515,4,really liked this even days 2 3 didn t follow exactly but pretty close i think that s the beauty of dumplings you put in what you have not what you don t added a little seitan for substance some garlic chive would be in this,224
161334,308889,5,these were quite i took the advise from other ratings and doubled the seasoning for the chicken since used 4 chicken breasts also i used spinach herb wraps instead of flat bread and this 6 servings the flavor of the seasoning was very and the cilantro in the cream sauce was for the i ll be making it again,306
22112,45001,4,this tasted really and was to but being pressed for time i didn t want to roll the dough into sticks i tried rolling 1 4 of the dough about 1 2 inch thick put it on a baking sheet and then cut it with a pizza cutter about 1 inch wide then i brushed it with olive oil butter would have been better and sprinkled with garlic etc my family will want these breadsticks often,370
214147,308961,4,i this with sweet potato instead of pumpkin but we loved it just the same perfect with a tossed salad for sharing,113
22267,225096,5,first off i should admit that i bought too lean a roast i picked up a sirloin roast instead of a chuck roast i m not with purchasing chunks of meat and forgot what i needed i only subbed a couple of other things didn t have onion soup mix so i used a pkt of mccormick pot roast seasoning and used beef stock for the water the potatoes were yukon gold scrubbed skin on and quartered followed everything to the letter aside from those things and cooked on low for 8 hours the gravy and veggies were but since the meat was so lean it became tough i didn t want to give up so i cut it into chunks and topped of with about 1 c of beef stock and cranked it up for another 8 hours while i went to work the meat was tender and shredding apart and the potatoes were actually still holding up this is a buy the right cut of meat and save yourself the extra 8 hours of cooking though lol love the horseradish in the mix adds a little tang to the gravy for such an,952
25634,49360,5,my husband was totally amazed well really we all were this was so rich and in my attempt to create more meatless meals i tried this we all loved it took a little time to put together but it was worth every minute very cheesy and full of flavor nurse di another winner,267
51257,645009,5,we this pie and ended up making another one that night it went too quickly this is a wonderful pie to do and completely the sour cream is the best idea and blueberries shine anywhere you put them,195
182429,1015482,5,very but a tad too much garlic if i again i ll only use 2 cloves and maybe add a bit more cayenne pepper,104
77185,654946,5,not too difficult and extremely we loved it i up a batch of masala 577 garam masala and used homemade spiced ghee instead of oil fabulous,137
364693,2328777,5,i am a new yorker with a love for southern grits this is one of the best i have ever the is and the outcome is heavenly,119
85031,88733,4,this review is based solely on the peanut butter icing i used this on the dark and decadent chocolate cake this icing is not an overwhelming peanut butter flavour which is however i think that i would cut back on the butter next time it was a bit much i also only used 3 cups of icing sugar because i sifted it to prevent lumps again for a,339
65353,645589,4,looking for chicken spiedini with capers and found this wonderful added more lemon over chicken breasts before drizzling over the sauce also added sliced black olives and doubled the sauce also cooked the chicken in olive oil instead of spray turned out,253
309363,1611831,4,yum what a mix of flavors for a healthy dish my only complaint is that seeing that the dish was supposed to 8 servings i cut the in half and found i really had only 2 3 servings i suppose we just liked the dish so much that we were piggies but it really did small servings,272
165254,1531537,5,turned out perfect rainy day steak,34
4496,647466,2,i this tonight and the hubby i weren t crazy about it the 7 year old liked it though it did raise up and brown nicely this is what i did differently i added a tablespoon of vinegar to the milk as a buttermilk substitute i used melted butter in place of the oil otherwise it was the same it didn t have any flavor we did detect an unwelcomed odor taste which was possibly the baking powder,388
99500,1335842,5,i was given yellow plums and wanted to something i could us as a gift this was perfect i a hawaiian style sauce that uses apricot preserves and will be modifying that to use this sauce from now on you for a,206
33921,380162,2,i really didn t think this was anything to rave about i may have not let the lentils cook enough since they were still a little but hard but i just wasn t feeling this maybe this would be a better option for someone who s strictly vegetarian i m not i don t plan on making this again,283
354979,2001216626,5,perfectly cooked rare ny steak bravo,36
90765,1386355,5,i have never challah before and i decided to for this shabbat i had to substituted the white flour for spelt and the sugar for honey and while i was making it i added a little prayer to the almighty and it was it worked really well everyone raved over it you gave instructions which helped me out a lot and it to follow,319
28496,1530179,3,this is a solid meal but nothing exceptional it was a work week dinner but won t become a regular rotation for us i did slight modifications i put a layer of coursely chopped onion in the bottom of the crock pot and used 1 5 cups of chicken broth instead of water and boulion i also used a whole crock pot chicken and rubbed it down with the minced garlic and spices and used 2 fresh lemons squeezing out the juice then tossing in the crock pot with the chicken and onions to cook for the afternoon 6 hours later it was falling off the bone moist tender i thickened the juices in the crock pot and poured over the chicken and rice,630
84051,232532,5,i truly enjoyed it i did not like the way the liquid bubbled over in the microwave so i think i will use a deeper dish next time other than that it was very texture and reheats amazingly,186
390449,1211187,5,wow i tried this because i m growing lemon basil in my herb garden and needed to use it i was pleasantly surprised by these wonderful muffins the cornmeal is a balance to the blueberries and lemon basil you can t taste the actual basil just the flavor of it i ve tried many different blueberry muffins on recipezaar submitted by cooks the other muffins were but these muffins are the best definitely my new family favorite blueberry muffin so much for sharing i can now wipe out the rest of my blueberry muffin recipes and replace it with this one,547
253657,636267,2,the is very thin almost crepe like and far far too sweet for my taste however the smell of them was divine and i think hey would be with sour cherries and a dollop of whipped cream rather than traditional butter and syrup my sweet tooth kids loved them me not so much you for the it did my boys happy,300
62778,129992,5,being a huge fan of cpk i purchased both of their cookbooks but only just got around to trying my favorite pizza the thai chicken this is not a copycat but the actual restaurant and having eaten this pizza every time i get a chance i can attest that this is the real thing unfortunately the closest cpk is about 90 miles away but now that i can reproduce my favorite pizza here at home i can have this treat more than once a year i used cpk s honey wheat dough which is what i get when i eat there and it was outstanding even though i didn t let it sit overnight in the fridge i think the only change i would to this would be to decrease the amount of sauce that actually goes on the pizza i think 3 4 cup is a tad too much and much more than they put on in the restaurant fortunately the sauce is delish but i think too much just takes away from the really combination of flavors from the crust the carrots bean sprouts and cilantro kimke for posting this you beat me to it it s definitely a must try if you re looking for something other than pepperoni pizza p s if the leftovers of the homemade pizza are half as as the restaurant s i m in for a lunch tomorrow too,1167
67035,342877,5,this for dinner tonight it was superb i think some people had difficulty with the batter the key for me was to first coat the fish with flour then put it in the batter it sticks to the surface better that way i also topped with corn and onion that i roasted on high in the oven for 15 minutes and for salsa just used the trader joe s salsa de cabo,347
123437,366277,5,this was my 1st experiment with turkey chops i ve had pork and beef removed from my diet by my trainer i found this to follow i added fresh lemon juice because i like that lemon pepper combo it was just excellent full of flavor and the meat was tender and juicy this is a permenant addition to my menu s for sharing,315
121629,118669,5,i loved these beans they are authentic and just like they taste in texas since i don t have an heb close to me i used cumin oregano garlic chili powder in place of the bean seasoning for the beer corona i also suggest soaking the beans overnight for the bacon i used a ham bone left over from a spiral cut ham,309
276583,316094,5,okay i admit i had to a few changes i didn t add the raisins or walnuts i must have used them all up over the holidays and i used 2 pint jars of 243773 for the apples since i didn t have any of the store bought stuff despite the changes this bread came out beautiful moist on the inside and a little crispy on the outside yum i did 2 trays of mini bundts with this and baked them for just 16 minutes this is an cake like bread that i ll definitely be making again so much for submitting,486
200296,1736825,5,this was sooo i used 3 sized chicken breasts and it was done in 30 mins for the d,81
372349,1834416,5,this was super as i a few changes i used the pie crust from thomas keller s ad hoc cookbook which uses butter instead of shortening i bought 2 rotisserie chickens and used only the breast meat i am not sure that i would use the entire 2 1 2 cups of heavy cream next time maybe just 2 cups i had to pour some of it off after i cut the first piece it does need to set up for about 30 minutes before you cut into it it s still very warm again this was super and amazingly wonderful enjoy,484
196280,33228,3,my children enjoy tuna and that is what i used in this they loved it,68
63420,296081,5,oh boy are these i took these over to my sister s house for christmas eve everyone loved them they are a lot bigger than i was expecting too which was it s like eating spinach artichoke dip rolled up in a pastry i just put everything in my processor and gave it a few pulses very quick and for sharing,301
116345,200930,5,this was more than outstanding absolutely and i couldn t believe how the ingredients all came together so well i served this with carrots on the side but they really were unneccesary this dish is a meal in itself for posting,224

263305,45709,5,i just served this up at my dd s grad party yesterday everyone commented how wonderful they were to the point i didn t even get to taste not even one but based on the many comments on their goodness and the fact that it was the first thing gone from the table hey it deserves 5 stars i did the honey mustard dressing instead of the ranch but followed the rest of the directions to the tee,388
215637,2770902,5,would love to use this but states quot do not store can build up and explode quot i would have liked a general time frame limit for this,136
46309,181231,5,i also grew up eating this although i havent tried adding boiled eggs iam sure it would be i do mine in the processor and add shredded cheese i also turkey ham and even roast beef sandwhich spread all are wonderful,214
285570,1490154,4,jose peppers is ok but being from jo co i have to tell you that miranchito blows the doors off jose p s try their espinaca it is with white cheese ive tried to it at home and now that i ve found this i use cacique cheese from the local grocery store this is the closest i ve found to miranchitos cheese my mom use to use velveeta for nachos on movie night when growing up sorry mom no longer a kid i prefer a real cheese,420
5408,38717,5,this was wonderful i also put garlic around the tenderloin while it baked and added some mushrooms cut in half during the last 20 minutes of baking you so much for this wonderful moist for the tenderloin,203

339752,2002892497,5,i these every year last 4years and they are so so so popular i usually double or triple the batch as a result i mine a bit smaller about 3 4 inch balls and use a lot more coconut for topping but knowing that i m always prepared these were my dads second favorite cookies and i always feel so satisfied making them they re a very manual cookie lots of hands on work but i ve never not gotten compliments on them,410

46362,462571,5,i ve this many times and it s sooooo highly recommended it is not hard to so don t be intimidated i substitute 1 medium sweet onion cut into large chunks for the frozen onions if you can t find creme fraiche just use sour cream or heavy cream about 1 3 cup or your own creme fraiche with 51727,293

31045,1672906,4,very i used the raw approach and this dish came,47
67654,2217969,5,this is an excellent chili love the spices blend it with 2 lbs of ground turkey instead of ground beef and cut the salt in half because i m not a fan of salt otherwise followed the to the letter so flavorful i didn t even miss the beans,236
206594,309422,5,i these for a side dish to dinner yesterday and they were the only change i was that i added some garlic powder you couldn t tell that they were low fat wonderful,162

222217,143946,5,this was my first attempt at marmalade and it turned out although i did not add pectin i followed directions on another which suggested chilling a small plate in the freezer and then adding a spoonful of marmalade on the plate and sticking it in the freezer for 30 seconds if it jelled with just a little movement it was done mine set up beautifully thankyou,358
466209,2002208456,2,this bread was awful west indians always use freshly grated coconut not shredded not dessicated etc less sugar and what in heavens name is coco lopez,149
216908,501082,2,didn t care for this i think it was the anchovy paste that i didn t like next time i will omit it and add 3 4 cloves of garlic,126
54332,6836,4,this was to put together although i probably added at least another 1 4 of milk to get it to a frosting consistency thought the flavor texture was and will likely it again it s a frosting alternative for my diabetic dh might be fun to experiment with different pudding flavors too for posting mary,297
134725,456593,5,very very i also subbed lemon for lime and it was,49

80076,817413,5,i added some salted peanuts and that was really i did have a problem getting them small enough but that s clearly operator error they are super rich,148
40169,217369,5,i tried this during the first snow of the season and it was met with rave reviews for the addition to the collection of baked potato soups,138

351929,1802809729,5,for powellsanmiguel sounds like you over toasted the sesame seeds too bad the was my substitute was to use a ginger paste rather then fresh ginger my second time making this is tonight and i will extra sauce,207
158911,371464,5,these cookies are my family ate them as fast as i them didnt change a thing on the will them again and again for sharing,120
201386,444944,5,a couple of things i did different was to use canned in water artichokes and to add the garlic which i chopped quite fine into the butter and olive oil right away i also didn t add the extra butter oil and cheese at the end i also put just enough hot pasta into a large bowl for 4 light servings added the sauce to the bowl tossed then added a little more pasta as was needed to get a sauce to pasta ratio to sure the sauce would be adequate for the amount of pasta and reserved the remaining unsauced pasta for another use later next time i think i would put three cups of the artichokes in because i really like artichokes,624
437610,1453523,5,my husband isn t into italian so it was a struggle to get him to the olive garden he of course was only willing to try the pizza on our first trip on our second trip i him promise to try something else he had zuppa tuscana he was hooked i figured i d try to this for him at home he loved it exactly exactly exactly like olive garden,332
189068,202992,5,very fried chicken just as i remember eating in georgia the coating was very and actually stayed on the chicken i like that it was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside keeping the southern tradition alive in az you,224
55424,788414,5,so and so misread and thawed the turkey so cooked entire time on low but still came out incredible will again without bothering to thaw next tme,144
78639,240832,5,i had to give this the highest rating because i never eat any of the lasagna recipes that i and i absolutely loved this one there is a deli that my husband gets chicken lasagna from for his faculty and they love it so he wanted me try to re create it the difference between yours and theirs we think is the cheese used we use alot of provel here in st louis and maybe a little more garlic i will be using your again but will try to use provel cheese instead and maybe add a little more garlic for a,498
37989,56149,5,i added just a little more chile for extra kick since my hubby and i like really spicy foods i liked the fact most of the cooking was simmering time you also don t need many ingredients dish even if the picky kids didn t eat it,227
385174,2001558658,5,i am new at using our instant pot this is the first that has turned out very others i have never again i only had 2 pounds of beef ribs but i used the same amount of spices i will these again soon next time more ribs also the directions were to follow you for this,264
313442,2002532083,5,i just added more cheese bec i wanted it super cheesy and it turned out so,74
28977,96752,4,treatment be aware that the 1st two teaspoons of salt are for the initial salting of the cucumbers and not for the marinade also if using a slightly more mature cucumber it may be better to halve and seed it first,213
97952,135557,5,i them with whole wheat flour and added a small handful of semi sweet chocolate chips they didn t come out of the pan well though i may try them in cupcake papers next time,172
113303,731266,5,i m not normally a pb cookie girl but wow these are wonderful 9 minutes is perfect for that chewy cookie even a few days later,126
17033,225118,4,very however we added about 6 crushed ritz crackers low salt version instead of the flour and instead of the celery salt we added salmon seasoning 1 2 tsp 1 tsp parsley flakes as well we also substituted 2 green onion chopped instead of a plain onion we also patted the patties with more crushed ritz cracker crumbs before frying served them with a zesty lemon dill aioli i they were very,388
18601,2000158386,4,i tried and followed the it cooked well on the outside but was mashy on the inside the taste was especially the milky butter taste what suggestions would you give me to it fluffy and soft next time,197
4287,4103,5,this was in order to the even easier i substituted the sweet potatoes with canned sweet potatoes and it still came out the entire family loved it including the kids and my sister and mother in law asked for the secret,217
300850,1410620,5,i was also looking to create a pizza just like boston pizza s spicy perogy pizza and this is it in fact i think it was even better i didn t have any mozzarella cheese but i used jalape o peppered cheese gives it a little kick i also didn t have any onions on hand but i used victorian epicures 3 onion dip mix and that did the trick i am actually making this for a second time this week lets see if my dh loves it as much as i do you so much for posting i know i will be using this many more times and its so 5 stars again it was super,535
99771,347559,4,to and uses ingredients i always have on hand,45
53074,755277,5,for a potluck we had on a camping trip this last weekend and everyone loved it for sharing,90
8619,2001960292,5,loved this just doubled it to for a family potluck and the everyone loved it especially the kids i added a little pepper jack cheese to spice it up i will definitely be making again and experimenting with different cheeses,222
119435,322548,4,i really enjoyed this dish it was a joy to eat and i had to restrain myself at just one helping i only gave four stars for the following reasons during the prep instructions it says combine the next five ingredients i duly did this then read add 1 tsp of the oil to a pan was the oil that i had just put in the sauce uh oh but it did say put the next five ingredients in i was worried it would the sauce greasy the second point was the called for spring onions and never mentioned them again i was unsure of where they should go sauce or pan so i added some dried spring onion to the sauce instead despite the above it turned out well and was definitely a keeper,662
415393,744425,4,quick i used 1 2 the amount of gelatin 14g because 1oz 28g it seemed like a lot even with cutting down the amount i had a bit of difficulty getting all the gelatin to dissolve in such a small amount of liquid the boiling water cooled off way too fast so i heated the water gelatin mix a bit gently on the stovetop and it dissolved just fine after that the mousse set just fine and was,384
54257,670089,5,5 stars because it was to and my very picky eaters liked it after reading some of the reviews i substituted the slice of bread with some stuffing ground into crumbs with processor for more flavor 1 slice of bread 1 4 cup of crumbs also the first time i this the sauce tasted very vinegary my guys did not like it at all so the second time i the sauce a couple of days in advance to let the flavors marry and some of the vinegar evaporate much better my picky eaters thought i used a different meatloaf and i wasn t about to fess up reducing the amount of vinegar the sauce taste too ketchupy you for sharing,607
282884,427222,5,these are you i followed the tip about putting butter and garlic salt on the outside it was a touch i used two cups of cheese and about a cup of sauce they were a hit with the husband too,187
31958,221776,5,this is a for oven fried chicken very and low fat i didn t dirty even one pan or bowl while making it i put the mustard worcestershire sauce in a cheap gallonsize ziplock bag added the chicken thighs and wiggled it around to coat the thighs you could do this in the a m and have it ready for the coating when you get home then i put the breadcrumbs in another bag and i just transferred 1 2 pieces at a time from one bag to the other for the coating process i lined my oven broiler pan bottom part only with reynolds nonstick foil really neat stuff so i didn t have to have a greased pan after baking the chicken i removed the foil and since it hadn t torn at all my pan underneath was perfectly clean yahoo threw away 2 ziplock bags and used the oven foil to wrap around my leftovers not greasy at all of course it would depend on how greasy your thighs might be mine were very lean next time i will this with a mustard that i love maybe a beer mustard or raspberry mustard etc i m not crazy about dijon even though i want to like it the flavor definitely comes through so i do advise people to use a mustard that they really like my parsley had been frozen so i put it in with the mustard instead of the bread crumbs the would be fine without it too i added some pepper onion powder garlic powder and a dash of cayenne to the mustard mixture for the bread crumbs i used italian as that s what i had on hand next time i d like to my own wholewheat breadcrumbs i won t mind dirtying the processor since i don t have to dirty much else for cooking time i used a convection oven and since my thighs were boneless they spread out quite a bit i set my conv oven to the 475 recommended and the oven automatically adjusts itself down 25 my thighs were actually done in 15 minutes before i even had a chance to turn them they really didn t need turning anyway they come out looking a lot like country fried steak that s what my husband thought they were when he saw them you karen i will use variations on your over and over i m sure,2026
126611,369018,5,did something a little different for this i omitted the artichoke hearts as i m not a big fan of them i got long skewers and after mixing the salad i put a couple tortellini on the skewer followed by red pepper square tomato etc i sprinkled fresh shredded parmesan cheese on top of the skewers after they were arranged on the platter looks wonderful everyone raved about it this an impressive presentation,405
49953,347768,4,it was very similar in taste to roast beef but with slightly different texture,78
12572,714171,5,my mom used to this when i was a kid and making it for myself now did not disappoint i used italian bread crumbs on the top my kids loved it i think i might sneak some mixed veggies in there next time,200
113180,927334,4,is it 100 identical to the store bought product no but it is really close i am right now making this for the 4th time the first 3 times i enjoyed it and i m pretty sure that i ll enjoy it this time too,201
74524,285820,5,with a slightly smokey and salty taste here is a neat trick to the eggs look pretty for serving leave the eggs in their shells after they are hard boiled then tap the shells against a hard surface to crack all over but leave the shell on once cracked place the eggs in the soy sauce mixture and let soak the eggs will still absorb the flavours but when you take of the shells to serve they will have a pretty marbled effect all over check out my photo,451
55665,140787,5,i this the other night and my dh decided this was his new favorite way for chicken he would have given it a higher rating than a 5 however myself and ds liked it but did not love it like dh i used provolone cheese i will probably try black forest ham next time i this,267
194466,302840,5,dish i this as a side dish for thanksgiving dinner and everyone absolutely raved about it dh claimed it was the best dish on the table i opted to omit the mushrooms so added additional beans instead and used cream of onion soup as a substitute for the cream of mushroom i reserved some of the french fried onions for a topping instead of topping with cheddar cheese this was by far the best green bean casserole i have ever tasted so much for sharing kittencal,460
12761,28784,5,to i couldnt stop eating yum,28
152231,204124,5,this for christmas dinner and it came out excellent followed instructions to the letter did not cover at all while cooking the outer ends were done enough for my mom who likes all her meat well done the middle part was medium to medium rare like the rest of us like it searing it first gave it a crust and it came out very juicy this will be my beef tenderloin from here on out 1 9 08 used this again this year for christmas dinner and it came out perfectly just like last year would give 10 stars if i could,508
198995,440634,5,these were so very to prepare and tasted fantastic i used a pre shredded 3 cheese blend and followed the exactly like another reviewer i too used pretzel sticks as the toothpick and toasted the nuts brought them to a party last weekend and they were the first and only item to completely disappear off the table tasted really with wine too for the cookathon for kittencal in john s memory,388
71373,296819,4,i have not tried alot of bread machine recipies yet but thought this was bread,78
451260,2002119180,1,mine didn t turn out right my bread machine is small and i had to adapt all the ingredients to 3 cups of flour instead of 4 i believe i did the maths right nevertheless after the 2nd time in the machine i popped out the dough on the floured surface and it was very wet and unworkable so i added more flour and put it back into the machine on the sweet bread cycle and was baked in there the result was edible but not,416
68350,1251255,5,i have this 5 times now these are the changes i have i preheat my oven to 500 and put a baking sheet in the oven then i roll out the dough on parchment and place all the toppings on then i place the parchment onto the hot sheet pan and bake for about 8 minutes this gives it a crispy outside crust this was still getting soggy in the middle so i another change now i only put the onions and bacon on top once it comes out of the oven i scatter some small spoonfuls of the creme fraiche mixture on top this makes the entire dough crispy i usually only use plain creme fraiche because it s hard to find fromage blanc,614
242323,306106,4,omgosh i thought i had rated these ages ago i must ve only put it in the sd zaar thread we really enjoyed the swordfish it was and the grill marks were beautiful we used our own homemade salsa which is quite spicy so i am not sure how much of the marinade came through just though and we ll it again and again greg,314
31014,38185,5,chicken i sauted the mushrooms in a little butter before adding them to the chicken also put in a teaspoon of garlic with the spices and to it a meal i put some small red potatoes in for the last 30 minutes of baking wonderful this has a very flavor i will this again,267
8949,56225,5,i thought it was to and i added a little tabasco to spice it up a little,72
32966,197788,4,i really enjoyed this used garlic powder instead of garlic next time i will roast it longer to let the sugars carmelize side dish,129
20072,101888,5,the family loved this i did one minor change i soaked the beef in a little red wine 20 30 minutes in the fridge this ones a keeper,130
99988,262090,5,i used rhubarb and apple and omitted the cinnamon from the fruit i loved it it was perfectly crumbly with a crunch,114
22782,789586,5,excellent used 1 cup of water and 2 lbs italian sausage and it turned out we ended up freezing some for a night that we need a quick dinner for posting,151
41318,55882,5,wonderful and full of flavor however next time i this i will cut back on the worc sauce just a tad keep em comming lennie,121
36252,56824,5,i used frozen corn broccoli red pepper for the cheese i used mozzarella parmesan are you using grated or fresh parmesan my fresh became brittle we enjoyed,154
156253,746803,5,fantastic combination of vegies very fresh salad for aus nz swap 39,67
26526,1376465,5,this bread is wonderful to follow and so i did reduce the sugar to 1 4 cup and it is still so,93
357712,625126,4,very very my only complaint would be that i thought the chicken was kind of dry but the gravy helps to tone that down really very,129
163307,239808,5,i really enjoyed this and definitely plan on making it again but i m afraid i did a couple of changes to it more of an italian style salsa verde i mashed the garlic parsley and olive oil with a couple of anchovies a bit of mustard capers and lemon juice i served the shrimp and sauce with linguine,297
140361,855658,4,i am in awe of this i m having it for dinner tonight i used celebrity brand canned corned beef for the meat which worked very well with the rest of the ingredients it the batter very consistent so that i didn t worry about having the right egg to otheringredient ratio in each patty the vegetables all being minced or sliced or naturally small the patty hold together better and the mold idea is wonderful i will never do egg fu yong without it again i m keeping the patties warm in the toaster oven at about 175 until they re all done i came across a variation in another to separate the eggs and beat the egg whites with a bit of cream of tartar in them to stiff peaks then fold the broken egg yolks back in this makes a batter that does an even better job of sticking to the ingredients and holding its shape,811
189270,474993,5,i reduced the amount of sugar to 1 2 cup added special k cereal slightly crushed and left out the chocolate chips these into 8 huge bars for all the energy i need during my competition,184
9272,220508,5,this was first but not the last time for making salsa next time i think i will put in the blender so it will not be quite as chunky but will not change anything else about it i also froze it instead of canning ps opps forgot the 5 star rating,242
34556,241892,4,i thought these were very they are light and slightly sweet i them with cranberries because we aren t fans of raisins my dh would have preferred a little more sugar and spice i think i ll add nutmeg next time,208
181208,457661,5,this was really and came out i served it with 74982 and a salad it was a huge hit for the lucid,95
165787,289272,5,very to creamy and very very we used a sourdough bread and placed it on a george forman grill and the sandwiches came out just wonderful tou very much for a meal jim,165
99361,94243,4,this was i think it could ve used some more sauce though next time i ll double the sauce and use as needed,106
21521,25959,5,you for this low fat for egg rolls my family can not tell the difference between the bake ones and or the fried ones again donna,128
44278,2002687232,5,honestly i m not a cook and i rely on recipes but most are very time consuming just to gather together making the prep time a lot longer than they say this was in comparison to do many other recipes and quite i liked that it only used things i always keep on hand and not too many different things i used butter instead of lard and added 1 tbs of better than boullion and some carrots to it my family loved it ours was a bone in 4 75 lb pork sirloin roast i was worried that it wouldn t be enough cooking time due to other reviewers but 1 hour and 45 minutes was just right the only change i ll next time is taking out the roast to fry up the onions and garlic more and deglaze the pan before adding the roast back in this will be in our regular rotation for meals you,768
112902,145797,4,my husband this yesterday he loved it he was unable to find ciabatta bread so he substituted sourdough bread fast lunch meal,124
380619,1725722,3,i m questioning the amount of flour in the pudding compared to other recipes it was low on flour and never really got thick enough the taste was but the cookies totally dissolved and left a grainier texture i brought this to guadalupe house 6 7 11,247
95524,454328,4,this was quick and and came out i used wild strawberry jello and it may have been a bit more sour than i was expecting maybe a different flavor next time or increase the amount of marshmallow it may also be my fault since i used marshmallow fluff instead of the mini s the girls loved the sight of it for a,306
13911,630195,5,to with ingredients on hand kids loved it no leftovers tonight,62
17954,58210,5,this is a family favorite i have changed the original to fit my family s spicy taste i add a can of rotel tomatoes to the ground meat and subsitute enchiliada sauce for the tomato sauce very,190
31427,42340,5,these are the very best tasting biscuits i ever put in my mouth hands down i have tried many different recipes but none can compare with the texture and flavor of these i used butter flavor crisco and they didn t need any butter they were so i two batches i used the iron skillet and it gave a little crunch on the bottom i love these biscuits,343
2072,72386,5,really taste and crunch we had this for dessert last night i served it with a large blob of whipped cream it was the perfect finishing touch,140
16980,67490,5,this is a wonderful that almost cooks itself i have it many time but yesterday i it with chicken tenderloins all i had on hand and it was even better because there was more surface area per tender to get more flavor i am able to the chicken and whip up some white rice while still being able to help my daughter with reducing fractions for a,341
55575,1800126269,5,trying to get away from store bought prepackaged seasonings this last night and it was will be using again,106
181106,1212548,5,i 039 ve been baking this bread for a year now making two loaves a week to keep up with the high demand for it in my house i mill my own grain fresh for every batch using hard red spring wheat this has got to be the best whole wheat bread i have ever eaten dbsnova for submitting it recently i a few changes to sweeten it up a bit i upped it to 1 2 c honey and 3tbsp molasses to sweeten it up a bit not that it isn 039 t as is but i 039 m one of those people who cant leave well enough alone,491
57836,464509,5,super i wasn t this exited until i got home from work the next day cut myself a piece took a bite and there it was heaven of course i immediately reached in the freezer for some vanilla ice cream what a pair,207
24263,142038,4,this was and to i have it as written and also switched out the pudding mix for some strawberry jello mix i had on hand though i only sprinkle part of the package in i find the whole package makes it too sweet,208
112705,180243,5,yum yum yum my tofu took longer to cook and i used brown rice but otherwise we followed this exactly and it is wonderful we doubled the and served seven people easily just had to do an update we this about 3 times a week now i like using the frozen brown rice whole foods that you zap in the microwave i saute chopped onions or shallots instead of green onions a dish,367
348587,440010,4,loved this risotto for the first time last night it had a really flavour and we ate it all up our tofu did come apart completely but that happens in a few recipes so may be down to the brand i use you definitely want the tofu as firm and dry as possible my only other criticism would be that unless you re serving this as a tiny starter there s no way it serves 8 people three of us the as given expecting to feed ourselves and have a one person portion left over as we feel risotto should have at least 500kcal per portion and actually we ate it up and had pudding still really flavours edit having come back to this some months later i ve realised that this is quite an ambiguous i set aside the onion mushroom cook the tofu add the rice but when do i add back the onions and mushrooms before or after the stock,813
104299,1203835,5,these were i was making dinner for a crowd and decided at the last minute that i wanted to a dessert so i found this and whipped it up in a hurry i really loved the flavor that the instant coffee added to the brownies next time i think i ll add some chocolate chips to them just because i love the extra rich taste,314
61616,146904,5,i remember my host parents this often and i really liked it i missed that so i this tonight my share mates also tried and all of them liked it you so much,154
56593,2439728,5,i could only find vanilla yogurt at the store so i used that and omitted the vanilla extract turned out best strawberry muffin that i have found,144
25600,157948,5,i used 4 large peaches and it came out i have this twice and my husband just loves it kep,89
46061,763293,5,this was very to and all 4 of my kids loved it you for your,59
43522,28345,5,i agree this is definately a keeper,35
394089,13131628,5,i used country style spare ribs and pork shoulder meat and simmered for 1 hour before adding the tomatillo chile onion mixture meat fell off the bone very tender and next time i it i will add pinto beans to the stew rather than serve refried beans on the side family really liked this dish mexican comfort,305
120306,273110,4,i this almost as directed omitting the salt since my leftover ham was a bit salty the sweet relish is a touch i my sandwich without the bread and dh s with whole wheat to without bread i dished my serving onto an oven proof plate and broiled until the cheese bubbled i broiled dh s open faced rather than skillet cook cookincowgirl very use of leftover ham,356
192346,1802687140,5,everyone is super stressed out about the health of these cookies but my motto is everything in moderation i love these as is although i don 039 t love chocolate so i used butterscotch chips instead i just eat 1 cookie for dessert and would rather have 1 deliciously sweet cookie than something that tastes like a vitamin store sorry i say this with love for my healthy sisters out there i too shop at whole foods i live at high altitude and these came out perfect with the addition of a few tablespoons of extra flour a must for anyone in co delish for those who find it watery or whose cookies spread try some extra oats or flour and never over beat your eggs butter i think these will be my go too sweet treat for nursing friends after having a baby i haven 039 t noticed any change in my supply but i am hoping these will help keep the status quo when i go back to work and rely on all day pumping,900
37336,442521,4,substituted sour cream for mayonaise absolutely wonderful,57
7169,936394,5,these taste i had mine with strawberries and cream,50
351561,1516651,5,this absolutely a goodness it doesn t have mexican in its name here or americans would have to pour cumin into it you can also cook dry pintos first its how my mexican wife makes it,181
4075,2001287621,4,just these and they are definitely i struggled a little with the instructions though i think it s a canadian thing but our condensed milk cans are only 10oz so rather than have to open a second can i tried to due with less because of this i had to sort of guess how much to put in with the chocolate and how much to put in with the minty part i overshot how much i needed for the mint so it ended up a little gooier and the chocolate part is a little more firm because the chocolate didn t have enough condensed milk it was hard to spread i ended up just doing a swirl with the mint layer and top chocolate layer which actually ended up looking quite pretty despite the mixed up consistency it still ended up being super i actually kind of like the chewier gooier mint bits,773
47195,403668,4,these were my daughter i whipped some up for a snack and they were gone in no time for the healthy idea,103
22430,611813,5,excellent jelly roll and a perfect strawberry cream roll will post picture shortly this will now become my quot go to quot jelly roll,133
168653,593980,2,not worth making again definably has an off taste maybe from the salsa,70
274189,648115,5,excellent flavor it took us about an hour for a roux that dark but it was worth it we also doubled the sausage just because we love it for the,142
85630,472275,4,super this is just like the best spanish rice you ve had at a mexican restaurant i tried this with both tomato sauce and pace picante sauce as a substitute i did prefer the tomato sauce over the pace this is just personal taste but i would use half the amount of onion for the,276
145267,601277,5,the tomatoes add a really flavor i used diced tomatoes with onion and garlic i could eat this all day long too a lot,116
414914,2002471431,3,it tasted but did not slices,28
161738,621358,5,i have this type of dessert for years and love it i add drained canned mandarin oranges to the as well,102
13582,354540,5,this was a different way of using leftover thanksgiving turkey and we really enjoyed it i added some pepper and 2 caps of low sodium soy sauce i used asparagus that i needed to use and subed cashews for salted nuts everyone inhaled it for a change of leftover turkey will again please note this did not do well the next day so would plan on finishing it the first night the chow mein noodles got really soggy,408
66703,1179118,5,by far one of the best peanut butter cookies i ve ever had chewie moist and full of flavor not flattening them gave them a different texture so they weren t overcooked and didn t have hard edges my 7 year old wanted them for his birthday treat instead of cupcakes for his school snack can t say i blame him,306
111734,100920,5,this is i didn t think it was going to come out to sharp but my hubby loved it as well i added mushrooms and i put the sauce and spices into the pan and fried it with it before mixing it with the noodles i also halfed the will again thanx,238
32614,543955,5,absolutely the easiest cookie ever also i used betty crocker devils mix and they are disappearing fast want to try spice cake mix for variation,143
276299,613927,4,excellent tasting my whole family really enjoyed the pork definitely a do over,78
112428,209447,4,really flavor i used lay s sour cream and onion chips i found that turning them was tough and they looked so before that for this no fuss,137
84987,1401261,4,i prefer the flavour of a yeast dough for pizza but didn t have time for one today and used this instead for being a yeast free dough it really was to roll out flavour i used olive oil in place of the salad oil as i prefer the added flavour of olive oil in pizza dough,268
54752,381538,4,the texture was very moist almost like a cake i decided not to add extra salt due to the worcestershire and catsup and it was perfect i had to keep it in the oven for 1 5 hours before it was cooked but the end result was,220
164706,693056,5,and to i followed the as is and it was i had no problem with coating the chicken with the egg cornstarach soy mixture the chicken alone without the sauce was the sauce thickened perfectly and tasted all the stores in my town and there are 3 major stores were out of dried chilies which was so odd but i had some type of chili sauce from a chinese grocery and i used that for some heat i this for company so i and fried the chicken in advance and had the sauce and set aside in a jar when they arrived i put the chicken in the oven and heated for a few minutes then turned on the wok added the onions and chili paste to some peanut oil added the sauce and it thickened up beautifully i then added the heated chicken and served with rice and steamed broccoli it was i did use low sodium soy sauce and low sodium chicken broth,823
52107,745067,5,i just your cinnamon rolls today and they are i tried a diffrent with bisquick last week and was so disapointed in them so i m happy to of found a i can use my husband thinks they are better then pillsbury rolls for the for people attempting to this the dough is a little sticky to work with if you flour your hands before kneeding it you will have less of a mess on ur self the dough should be soft and silky when your done kneeding it,436
15072,694250,5,definitely perfect chocolate brownies moist chewy never need to buy packet brownies again was super and quick to too i used parchment paper to line the pan so no sticking and drizzled melted chocolate on top for a little extra left out nuts too,244
399375,324790,5,this was refreshingly cool creamy and indeed a way to get some nourishment when your appetite is lacking the consistency is comparable to a soft sorbet i used low fat vanilla yogurt instead of the plain increasing it to 1 3 cup i found i did not need to use the honey the banana and the yogurt it sweet enough for my tastes to this easier to blend i suggest when freezing the bananas you flatten them down much easier on your blender for everyday holiday tag jan 10,465
234865,2002088453,5,i thought this sounded familiar i lost my copy of clayton s book 3 years ago and have been trying to find one as can t do better than this,138
273482,2002036900,5,super my husband and i loved them,33
59038,89240,5,this came out despite my changes i it crustless and used stevia powder and splenda instead of the sugar will this again soon,124
39059,58092,1,we ate this but that was it actually i didn t even want to finish it we threw the leftovers away it is terribly bland i won t it again,134
107440,868729,5,i didn t have the powdered peppers so i used jalapeno juice on mine we all loved our bacon along with our eggs for breakfast for sharing,136
356,382418,5,i used haralson apples and got rave reviews my only quibble was that a 9x13 pan is too big for this the topping didn t fully cover the pan and the apples cooked down so that it was barely a quarter inch think i d either double the or use a smaller pan,251
8701,151418,5,ribs are devoured with this excellent taste three kids and wife all ate the ribs ravishly if you don t like sugar you may wish to cut back the white sugar proportion i may try next time as an experiment for the labor day weekend treat,234
242966,262272,5,i am not a bacon lover i don t mind it as bacon bits added sparingly to other dishes i do like bacon fat to fry potatoes in i bought bacon bits in a bag once because my family loves bacon i wasn t impressed plus i didn t get any fat i needed bacon crumbled for another and remembered seeing this i didn t remember to partially freeze it so it didn t cut all together willingly but this was so when it was all done my family is going to be so happy to have bacon in their eggs and i can t wait to have hash browns with the fat they and i you from the bottom of our hearts,570
22782,26496,5,there really isn t more that hasn t been said for making my sunday night dinner fantastic,89
126110,228313,4,very much enjoyed this particularly as was not familiar with flambe ing meringue can t wait to start flambe ing other fruit in a similar fashion slices might be better for individual portions although the effect for the dinner table is spectacular,247
83625,2704337,5,perfect sweet cornbread it in a pan and it came out,51
81956,345234,5,this was outstanding i left out the leek and any type of noodles hubby is not a fan of pasta in soups but followed everything else exactly it was wonderful for a soup on a cold rainy night,188
16705,1438194,5,use quot sweet baby ray 039 s quot original sauce you 039 ll smack your mama,76
443621,1803033287,3,while i hate to be the bear of bad news but this is not the true for hardee 039 s biscuits it is close if i didn 039 t have such a close connection with hardee 039 s i would share the actual but lets just say it 039 s in the grease and rise best wishes and some changes you might just hit the right mix,302
230203,1061525,5,and the best chicken feet better than chinese dim sum,53
494491,1800157371,4,very was shocked somthing so would have such a flavor i reccomend diced green bellpeper however,95
68955,2217137,5,i cooked this exactly how the said except i didn t use a pepper i was a little skeptical at first from the strong vinegar smell but to my surprise the glaze the chicken taste best glazed chicken i ve ever had i agree with one of the other reviews if you don t like this you must have a mistake when cooking i put the chicken right in from the very beginning no precooking i served it with cooked broccoli rice with soy sauce drizzled over the rice glaze drizzled over the chicken broccoli i 100 recommend this it was very to,524
37336,2936110,5,damn i this with chicken tenders had leftovers and the chicken was even better then sauteed with evoo tomato and garlic over noodles my daughter loved it and so will you,169
147668,941480,5,this is a i used a large deseeded cucumber i omitted the parmesan and added oregano and lawry s season salt to give alittle flavor i will definatley this again,159
51574,363149,3,this was a quick and dish to prepare my husband and i enjoyed it but it was missing something for us we found it a little bland for our tastes but still a quick mid week meal,174
486737,2400418,5,i have had these in person and they are the best tasting burger i have ever had in my life by far the best in this competition,126
107786,1782877,5,i this all the time it s and sometimes i reduce the brown sugar a tad but mostly follow the,91
81591,130953,5,this was excellent i served it over basmati rice and it was well received by guests who had never before tried an ethnic dish of this variety very sweet curry because of the honey i might put more curry powder in order to bring some more intensity next time,257
373137,160205,5,this was the bacon added just the extra amount of flavor needed i d actually probably use an extra slice next time my slices were small i did have to use kidney beans as i couldn t find pigeon peas but the flavor was still for the,230
71755,387367,5,this was the combination of tamarind juice and coconut goes really well together i halved the and cut down the red chillies to just six but it was still really chilli next time i ll put in just 3 also don t try this with coconut milk powder its really hard to grind the masala still turned out though wow,304
422213,2000687442,3,too sweet and too much water,28
241623,2001639151,5,we used an egg and milk wash as well and then the coating and then the wash and another coating and then deep fried unbelievable puffy coating,142
172442,316094,5,okay this isn t necessarily a high rising pretty cake but what it lacks in appearance it more than makes up for in taste i wasn t sure it would turn out okay especially with no flour and no leavening but the end product came out moist with a light texture dh absolutely loved this cake and ate several pieces which was very unusual for him one suggestion to the prep really pulse the almonds and sugar in a processor then pulse in the cornstarch and whole pitted dates the dates chop up perfectly and the ground almonds sugar corn starch keeps the date pieces from sticking to each other this one s a keeper,607
330425,141277,5,i this with wild raspberries we picked this past summer everyone who tried it loved it there seemed to be a lot of juice when it was time to slice the pie i used a different crust from saveur com that is my go to crust but otherwise the filling was exactly as written i m not much of a raspberry pie fan so i only had a bite myself but i thought that with the wild berries i could have used a touch more sugar but that i think comes with using wild berries will again and will try it with domestic berries,505
68356,834565,5,light fluffy and totally this frosting was for sugar cookies and cake we loved it,81
206252,843289,4,i asked my family for their intake and this is what they gave this pasta i thought it was very and would have earned a five if i d maybe added a bit more butter the only complaint was that they were too garlicy but as i love garlic this wasn t such a bad thing would have a side to seafood or chicken,300
188012,1063871,3,ok if you do it right it does actually look like a brain if you can get past the fact that it is chunky in your mouth it doesn t taste half bad,143
102111,172114,5,i doubled the and added an extra tbsp of vinegar we served it for company and it was a hit will definitely again,112
422115,2000529614,5,exactly the fudgey i was looking for very did not do well with the gnache tho cake was wonderful,96
76754,1518818,5,this was a wonderful soup it was so creamy and filling the spices were wonderful we loved it we will definitely this one again,126
87748,241241,5,instead of soy sauce i used bragg s i also chose not to cook it in a separate pan i whisked everything together in a bowl added it to the stir fry once it was ready it came out this sauce was quick to throw together after a busy day,232
268616,412186,5,simply woderful quick east and,30
304166,1802854463,3,my sauce came out watery and pretty bitter note to self for next time sure the cucumber is sweet and not bitter also the does not mention this but use yogurt with fat that 039 s super important and helps reduce the bitterness i wish i had known before making mine also sure to cut out all the seeds in the cucumbers and salt them well the will come out very watery which is kind of gross,387
84504,510495,5,very was a hit with even the sweet potato haters,48
48012,64631,5,fabulous indeed i also added tsbp of vanilla and i can t say much were left to have once they cooled though they were warm out of the oven note on my next 4 batches i have cut the sugar down to less than 3 4 c with no change to the flavor texture,246
71499,53235,5,i ve stayed away from microwave popcorn cuz it always tastes like chemicals to me this rocks because it s been so long i even burned some of the kernels and the house didn t stink to high heaven you soooo much,209
399493,1256030,5,i half portion today and we ate it all taste something different quite original and very very i used more water and didn t use any cornstarch will definitely again,163
10614,94769,5,these last night using black beans and my picky daughter actually ate them i halved the and didn t have long time to cook them so i cheated i let them cook down a little and used a whisk to mash them up to the pasty texture quicker worked like a charm and had them ready when the rest of the was for posting,307
161355,282948,5,i this along with two others from the rsc 06 for a spring break theme night for my family everyone raved how fresh and it was my mom noted that the taste of the chicken could have stood alone but the salsa it they were eating the left over salsa the next day with tortilla chips i didn t have tarragon vinegar so i just added tarragon to the marinade with apple cider vinegar i up the salsa the night before and let the chicken marinade over night as well so the flavors really had a chance to mingle it s a low fat,515
15101,1647167,5,tasted for posting karen form colorado1,39
507543,1458727,5,this is how i my hashbrowns and it turns out every time i have to turn it on high on my stove sure the oil is and hot before putting in your potatoes one large idaho is just right for the two of us,197
19380,30080,5,this is a loved the addition of onion soup mix bf thought it was perfect for sopping up gravy,93
35593,230331,5,i sent this for my sons snack day at preschool when i picked him up the first thing he said to me was that everyone loved his snack this is a big deal because he never says anything about what they have for snack i followed the receipe but used scooby snack gracham crackers and i did add pretzels as someone else suggested,323
154133,616690,4,this was fantastic the chickpeas were a bit overwhelming to the taste so i would recomend trying it without them but other than that just,137
8803,195137,4,to but i ll try a tangier bbq sauce next time for more flavor,61
208745,333959,5,this is we call it chocolate yum yums take out the chocolate pudding and put in cherry pie filling and it 039 s cherry yum yums,127
46262,716303,5,the turkey came out perfect you,31
351808,2006538,4,very base if you don t have pancetta try to substitute canadian bacon but the meat onions and garlic together really pack a lot of flavor i also live to add a little fresh chopped italian parsley and a pinch of lemon zest for freshness,235
97428,1070427,5,first time salsa canner and i was intimidated by the 2 5 cups of hot peppers so i cut it down to 1 5 cups which was actually mild the second batch i bumped it back up to 2 5 and love it i ve already shared this with my friends and am planning on using this again and again,272
100876,57787,5,my daughter s boyfriend was over for dinner tonight and when i asked how many stars should i give this he said 7 this is an absolutely wonderful pie i added about 1 4t nutmeg and 1 4t allspice to the mix along with the cinnamon i put it into a 9 glass pie plate and baked it per directions i used a mix of jonagold and winesap apples i had those on hand and it was the next time i this i think i ll crumble the topping over it to apple crisp i ll definitely be making this for a long time to come,496
80964,765403,5,i thought this was a fantastic recipie tasted just like take away you sue l x,77
12485,195480,4,this came out pretty though a bit dry the garlic was not overpowering i think next time i will dress it up with a bit of parmesan,129
20984,1254516,5,best tasting flaky pie crust ever for posting i have been making this pie crust for a few years now and just love it comes out in a processor with just a few pulses i just shared it with my son who wanted to try to his own apple pie again for sharing,250
79914,930552,5,got this off the campbell s website to for my boyfriend and was making sure it was posted i am rating based on him and his friend who absolutely love this casserole as i personally do not care for it i used 2 cans of french style green beans,241
210757,326216,5,this taste just like any other broccoli and cheese soup you can t tell a difference in the lower fat calories i chose not to put the can of tomatoes in it this makes the 2 pts per cup i will try the tomatoes next time to save that point this is a snack for in between meals or before a meal so you don t eat as much of your main meal so much for sharing i also garnished with green onion,387
37459,211967,5,i actually thought these were to and i m not a very experienced chef they are very i think next time i will not put so much of the topping just so that they will be more like samoas they were still very the way i them this time i also did not have a candy thermometer so i used juju bee s advice for the,303
44487,253113,5,this is the most gluten free pizza crust i have probably 20 of these for my boyfriend and my friends i don t use the powdered milk and it comes out just fine we bake it for 10 min then grill it on our weber for another 10 15 minutes for a wood fired pizza flavor outstanding,274
363402,1409093,3,i followed the exactly but i didn t quike like it sorry the pancakes were okay with a dessert sauce but on their own i though they were too bland,145
11220,595584,5,i these cookies for my husbands birthday snickerdoodles are his favorite but not my first choice however these cookies are excellent they are now one of my favorite cookies and very to,184
31750,1468692,5,this is our go to fast and waffle we also have an overnight favorite i this with oil and vanilla milk substituted as we have a family member with an allergy to dairy protein these turn out perfect every time i have even been in a hurry and didn t separate the eggs and they still came out and crispy on the outside light in the middle,334
77397,2806514,5,mm mm mm all those that had to give a not so review should consider giving this cake another try it 039 s actually genius because it 039 s perfectly designed to give a you a doughy cinnamon roll kind of reminder everyone that said their cake came out spongy was not far off maybe just the balance of the remaining flavors your cinnamon sauce because that 039 s where your flavors will be coming from lt br gt the only thing i added was because after tasting it i had to have some cinnamon roll icing which is what i and put on top lt br gt lt br gt kitten,555
106228,128526,5,delicous this was extremely next time i ll add more crab we love crab i forgot how stuffed mushrooms were this is to and doesn t take long to prepare i served this as a starter at a birthday celebration meal for my mother everyone was most impressed diane in nebraska for a,273
187519,116463,5,adults and children loved this it was to i quadrupled the to 4 pizzas and i used my bosch mixer to mix the dough the first one i rolled out i neglected to oil the table first and had to re roll it after scraping the rolled crust off of the table after topping i baked them 2 at a time at 375 degrees for about 16 minutes swapping the top and bottom pizzas halfway the crusts were thin but not too thin and chewy i it with the written ingredients but did not allow it to rise for 10 minutes i was in a hurry so i only gave it about 4 5 minutes i will definitely this again perhaps putting in some whole wheat flour next time,623
8904,142386,5,i had these at an italian theme party this weekend they were fantastic however the only difference was the use of mozz cheese instead i almost didn t try them because i don t like peppers that much i was wrong you for posting,225
82644,315837,5,i used this seasoning to grilled chicken shwarma take boneless chicken breasts pound thin and rub with the seasoning some crushed garlic and olive oil grill the chicken pieces and serve in pita pockets with chopped tomatoes avocado shredded lettuce and hummus,259
87748,360813,5,definitely take note of the comments about the saltiness of the sauce however i find that mixing it in with the veggies or meat helps a lot so don t get put off at your first taste of the sauce try adding a little water to it after stir frying your veggies to help reduce the saltiness otherwise this is a damn for sharing,322
57062,905569,5,i m not a huge potato fan but my boyfriend absolutely loves these i different variations and like to incorporate bacon pieces chives and cheese throughout the mixture as well as on top i a huge batch and freeze them so its super for me to pull one out for my boyfriend gotta love an side,287
16144,324677,3,i left the milk out and still thought the soup s consistency was too thin and i used brand name cream soup the rest as directed but only because i was pressed for time this could use any number of additions to jazz it up may try again with the addition of fresh mushrooms and chicken or seafood,294
243931,1586695,4,i m 100 portuguese and i have to say that this is a pretty solid for old fashioned chourico and peppers,103
53099,40525,5,i have to give these 5 stars for taste however they definitely not breakfast i was skeptical about the lemon but it was really really especially the raw dough o however it might have been that i let the dough stand too long before baking but when i took it out to cut the bars fell apart any suggestions,303
198972,425574,5,i have never eaten a beef stew this ever i have also never tasted a beef stew like this it was very very and outrageously the reason i joined this site was to find recipes that are and impressive and that are unique this fits the bill completely it is also a very kid friendly meal mine loved it and asked me to it again it also makes way more than 4 servings i think 8 10 is more like it,388
147065,2397100,5,i have a different way of making broth i like to use chicken feet claws the broth comes high in protein and collagen and it s to do if you have a crockpot just let it run overnight the second day i used ms deen s cooking the chicken inside the broth from the day before this left an extremely rich broth so rich that the creme parmesan and noodles were overkill one thing i would add is a couple of tablespoons of habanero infused sherry,437
52107,74769,4,excellant as an quick option to yeast cinnamon buns or coffee cake best warm but still at any temperature i ll be sharing this with my family and friends i also added more flour definitely do not need the glaze earth in tb,222
223214,477972,1,i did 2 substitutions i used sugar free maple syrup and skim milk instead of soy otherwise i followed the something i don t usually do these did not taste to me at all i think there is too much ginger and it s very tart maybe regular syrup would have added some sweetness i m not sure my batch 22 regular size muffins i know i won t be making these again and they will probably end up in the trash,397
100215,839016,5,super quick and i it with ground turkey because that s all i had in the house but it still tasted i will definitely it again i m glad i doubled the because now we will have leftovers,182
346443,2000483465,5,can hardly wait to this do you know what the shelf life is for this,67
12458,106777,3,my dh really liked this but to me it was just a little i don t know uhmmmm it was rich and creamy but yet bland and tasteless is that possible the part was that the chicken literally fell off the bone i will this again for my dh but next time i ll use boneless chicken and something for me on the side,301
10294,253021,5,the taste was fabulous i halved the and baked it in my new star shaped silicone baking pan the texture and taste were very though a little too sweet i added 1 tsp of green cardamom powder along with the cinnamon pwd only problem was the cake stuck to the bottom even though i greased the pan the base which became the top after i took it out of the pan was sticky next time i will reduce the sugar by 1 2 cup altogether the with the addition of cardamom is excellent a keeper april 2 2009 it today for potluck and reduced the sugar to 1 1 2 cups it was lapped up instantly it was not too sweet but went well with my friends am going to use this again and agin,659
29598,120109,5,this is the best marinade i left it overnight and my whole family loved it even my two year old,95
122449,153145,5,i agree about the amounts of spices i just shook them on by eye but probably used about 1 tbs of seasoned salt and then used garlic powder and onion powder and some salt and pepper,180
35063,105459,5,ooooh i love this you for posting it it is very to and so i had only one large tomato and some red onion which worked nicely after the initial taste i added a bit more of the spices along with some ground coriander and the remainder of the cucumber it was so that i could barely stop eating it i can t wait to it again and again,328
423156,765074,2,too much pepper and salt for a pound of pork i could see 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper also 1 5 hours was too long as pork only needs to be cooked to an internal temperature of 160 f,196
441974,45551303,3,i have to admit i expected to love these pickles i wish i did i guess the sugar should have given me a clue that they really weren 039 t hot and spicy but sweet sweet sweet and spicy i really don 039 t like sweet picked so did a slight adjustment to the 32oz petite dills 2 3 of a 12oz jar of jalape,299
32618,2000154002,5,tried these with result i 039 ve modified the slightly tho first i 039 ve combined the beef with a bit of pork to get in some additional juices and flavors and then by finely dicing some bacon and onions and put both on heat until the onion turned gold left it to cool down and added into the meatballs mixture also fresh parsley and oregano them even better i 039 ve also tried cooking them directly in the sauce and frying them a bit first if you fry them in the pan don 039 t forget to put a bit of water or broth wine into the pan when you 039 re done scrape or cook off all that is left from the meatballs and then put it into the sauce you 039 d be missing out addition to the flavor of those meatballs,708
79132,118561,5,very it was so odd that i had to try it it does have a hint of pork rind taste but if you up the splenda cinnamon and vanilla a little and eat with low carb syrup it s hardly noticeable they re a alternative to expensive low carb mixes,235
54026,83847,5,have this several times and it is a winner i found it in an australian womens weekly cookbook i have served it to friends and they are always very immpressed,157
156846,441981,5,everyone loved these i used 1 lb baby carrots and 1 2 packet of hidden valley ranch dip mix we have these several times,119
53688,2001781745,5,this soup at least 10 times already family can t stop eating it they go back for seconds the veggies do need more time i cook them for about 80 mins instead of the recommended 30 just because i like carrots super soft and this time i used ketchup instead of tomato sauce omg super,280
184668,430956,5,the best internet i ve ever found 28 95 resturant quality but i used orange infused olive oil and 8 year aged balsamic vinegar really outstanding i this again and didn t use the aged balsamic and orange infused oil just used standard olive oil and cheap balsamic and it simply didn t compare,291
446809,2000315522,5,i can 039 t wait to try this currently my dough mix is outside rising because it 039 s warmer outside than in i have a chicken jalfrezi so this naan will go perfect with that i will let you know the outcome,206
73274,2005306,5,very to i had never homemade caramel before this is to and the most caramel i have ever had yum i it several times a year,121
198794,398964,4,i this using whole eggs instead of egg whites or egg substitue also didn t have any fresh chives or dill around it was however next time i ll be adding a little more spinach,173
9538,21487,5,excellent i doubled everything but the chicken and of course added once clove crushed it s the law with me to add garlic of garlic and then served it on a bed of wild rice the extra sauce i put to the side for each person to use more if desired and they did really a delightful change for a chicken dish oh and ps i served asparagus spears for the veggie with a touch of the sace over the top,392
138897,436387,5,i recently this for the first time and my whole family loved it it s really to i left out the green onions it s by itself for a snack or as a side salad,152
40107,154026,5,while i love anything with peanut butter dh considers it a of the devil however if he doesn t see what goes into a meal he s none the wiser this was so to put together we re trying to watch our fat intake a little so i used a can of carnation evaporated milk lite with a few drops of coconut extract tastes the same this is to put together uses regular ingredients and is as as a meal for family as it is for company leftover freeze well and it reheats well next time i this i m going to try it with fish thankyou fair weather cook for sharing this,548
221921,1132665,5,this is a real winner i it for my family at christmas and everyone loved it so much they wanted me to another one the following morning it s so why limit yourself to having it just for breakfast serve it breakfast lunch brunch or dinner heck even a midnight snack would be,272
33159,522505,3,i think i did something wrong although its hard to see where i did but i did not care for this dish it certainly sounded but something was off i will try again though hopefully it comes out better,196
122304,2362867,5,this is the only buckle i 039 ll ever use again so warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream,89
515167,1802646278,5,tummy pleaser,13
282990,455010,3,the flavor seemed bland so i added 1 4 cup onion and 3 garlic cloves to step 1 it had a flavor and got rave reviews from my bff s will again,140

9240,41799,5,quick and what more could you ask for i 1 2 since there were only 3 of us and it was plenty as suggested i used french vanilla pudding and chocolate fudge frosting both provided real eclair taste this would be a dessert when entertaining a large family or crowd for sharing marianne,282
25394,1168645,5,my husband and i really enjoyed this it is really really especially if you are a blue cheese lover like we are and for sharing,126
84247,304290,5,these were so very i doubled the garlic used the fresh parsley and then added a little bit of cayenne pepper to the panko crumbs i followed the instructions to up the temp to 425 and flipped them after ten minutes so much,221

385579,2001130678,5,i found this years ago on a vegan site that is no longer around and was worried i wouldn t be able to find it again but found it here i have been making it for years and everyone loves my rolls i them smaller than the suggests and get 24 from the i am vegetarian but i do a lot of vegan foods but i have used real butter in the and it turns out just the same however one time i tried dairy milk to see if it would work and i found they were not as the crumb was drier and i don t suggest it i have a few tweaks to the and i think it makes them really i use vanilla soy milk or very vanilla soy milk and it s super i also increased the amount of salt to a scant tablespoon then i do them smaller i simply break up the dough and loosely form it into a ball and bake them about 15 minutes i highly recommend this,809
105035,487940,4,this is and i had this in a crock pot cookbook of mine and searched to see if it was already up and here it is i use whole wheat bread and it still works the kids eat it up my variations are 1 2 cup raisins 1 tsp cinnamon i might try adding 1 tsp vanilla next time too i use rice milk as i have a dairy allergy i also will omit the sauce and sprinkle it with cinnamon sugar instead as it is easier that way for posting,418
94475,1244621,5,well i would love to say i actually tasted this but by the time i was able to eat dessert at our memorial day cookout the whole thing was gone my husband i both did not get any of it so he asked me to one for home soon everyone loved it and kept asking for the i used low fat brownie mix by betty crocker and it turned out can t wait to taste it myself,352
58823,177688,5,i did not add oil butter and i cooked the meat onions and garlic together other than that i exactly as written and it was very normally i am not a big fan of rosemary and i almost substituted thyme but i am glad i did not as others have written the flavors blended well and the sauce was,287
71203,868407,5,this is a very and the pickles are i substiuted onion powder for the sliced onions and also added a little cayenne pepper to them spicey,136

114127,868729,5,we just loved this casserole to prepare this comfort really tickled our fancy,77
22782,1517579,5,this is by far the best spaghetti sauce i have ever tried i did what most people said on the reviews and used less water only enough water to rinse out the tomato sauce cans it it the perfect consistency my family absolutely loved it 3,235
89483,311260,5,this is absolutely i can t leave well enough alone so i brushed the mushroom caps with vinaigrette as well and left the gills intact i added the juice from them back into the vinaigrette i also sauteed the prosciutto in a nonstick pan till a bit crispy i served it to my oldest dearest friend and she wanted the so it must be fabulous of course country lady is a fabulous chef so what you would you expect,405
149945,285974,4,what a wonderful combination of flavors my family loved these,61

281909,499114,5,this is really and i it with two boxes of stove top i used a can of french style geen beans i also used two cans of canned chicken that is one of my favorite shortcuts i used the healthier cream soup and fat free milk i added some frozen corn and a can also added more cheese i think that this turned out really next time i might try some other things that i like in it for a new favorite,388
141983,2272957,5,i this alfredo sauce a few weeks ago but i adjusted my a bit my husband and i love it i was so burnt out on canned alfredo sauce that i would not even chicken or shrimp alfredo anymore i will use this for life,209
430574,2153470,5,i love all buckwheat pancakes so like teresalue i replaced the other flours with buckwheat yum,94
181546,2000447343,5,this has been the most banana bread i this for family and friends and it was gone in 15 minutes as soon as it came out of the oven and had time to cool the aroma drove everyone crazy i was able to swipe a hefty piece of it before it was all gone we love nuts which it more delightful but it 039 s just as without any i am thankful to martha stewart for sharing this with us you martha and you com,396
302025,1260386,5,we sometimes add chocolate chips on special mornings and two of us can eat the whole batch before evening,105
45809,300474,5,this was very i also have used the liquid with shrimp and it works very well i put the shrimp in at the last min,112
12572,250238,4,these were rather plain i think some addition of red pepper or spice of some kind may have gone a long way in helping them out the pastry crust was perfect they just need some tweaking to the filling don t be scared to try them just do your best to kick them up a notch,269
98584,181905,5,this was i added some fresh ginger and mushrooms that i had in the fridge and i also substituted chicken breast for the steak i also preferred adding some crushed red pepper for a little kick everyone loved it i will definitely this again for posting,250
8554,12129,4,my family loved it it isn t the most gourmet looking thing but it was very i might add a couple squirts of tabasco to give it a little kick very,144
165650,2057200,4,the colors are so inviting,26
129040,1841469,5,just these and they turned out my 2 year old son kept trying to sneak them lol,78
26297,25356,5,i was a bit skeptical when i saw the gravy ingredients after mixing them up but this was the chops literally fell to pieces when i took them out of the crock dh ended up eating all the leftovers before they had a chance to be leftovers i was content just to eat the gravy over noodles yum,288
44587,61872,5,not only is the butter it is fun to it s definitely one of those meals you enjoy serving to company i didn t any adjustments and the preparation was very the taste was a bit more mild than i anticipated but still very i used a faux filet,237
245169,427101,3,i wanted to give this 5 stars i really did my family really loves pumpkin seeds but these turned out way to sticky the actual taste was wonderful but they never really hardened for us if that s what they re supposed to do i followed the directions and even let them cool overnight to see if the outcome would change though i had fun photographing them,351
76940,38086,5,i didn t have my normal seasoning packet for mongolian beef and it was too late to run to the store and get it so i found and this oh my gosh it was everyone loved it served over cooked rice it is so and so it will be many more times in the future for sure,256
20048,737261,3,not an or quick i agree with everyone who says there is too much breadcrumb mixture i used it to 8 pork chops i didn t care for the flavor personally,149
128257,423778,4,healthy i think a more tart apple works best i also used two apples rather than one if you want a more distinct cinnamon flavor i would also suggest increasing the cinnamon,172
12967,166860,5,these muffins were wonderful i did not have any pan liners so i just sprayed the cups with pam they came out everyone loved them,128
33262,867847,4,this was my first time cooking and eating tempeh the was very for me to follow and the meal came out i chose it because it sounded a bit similar to one of my favorite foods my boyfriend s pad thai i think this sauce was even better though it is so creamy from using the peanut butter and the leftovers were the next day after the tempeh really had time to absorb the flavor of the sauce,386
64104,510821,5,this cake is sooooo i added shredded coconut to the top which it look beautiful too,83
222018,1292790,5,quik and and taste i it with pistachio sf pudding mix a must try,64
134001,2824219,4,the is a out of better homes and garden 039 s cookbook no mistake this is the way a pancake should be its light and fluffy as one other person suggested add vanilla extract to this the only reason i gave four stars is that the serving size is not right this makes about 12 pancakes with a half cup of batter,307
206892,295591,5,very next time i will add less water sese the ice makes it a wee bit watery,75
8794,219865,4,this was really added diced mozza and cucumber and used tri colored rotini and low cal version of the dressing took to a bbq and came back with an empty bowl,157
31907,142457,5,you you you for submitting this i have been looking for it goodness i was able to finally find it,97
122787,235493,5,mmmmmm tastes just like the real thing i used splenda instead of sugar for calorie reasons but it tastes,104
259573,721674,5,so much for teaching me how to do this eggs always frustrated me they were always runny or over done i will use this method forever so and i followed instructions and was thrilled when i peeled woo hoo fellow canadian for posting,229
43687,65148,4,this went over well but i had to add a little more honey to suit my younger kids tastes spin on an old favorite,111
354858,706053,4,a basic soup i used smoked pork ribs about 250 300g added a stick of celery a potatoe makes the end result creamier and a finely chopped fresh green chilly i grow my own herbs and added a boquet garni of sage thyme and ropsemary tied up with string oh yes added the onion whole with a few cloves stuck into it i think a tart apple would also add interest a granny smith here in south africa lovely rich soup for a blustery winters day,434
147161,2001829318,4,not as flavorfull as i expected and required far longer cooking to avoid soft center i used chopped frozen cherries and unsweetened coconut so they would certainly have reduced sweetness,186
364729,685371,4,i this for dinner last night and thought it was it went together really fast and i spiced it up a bit with crushed red pepper and garlic salt a weeknight dinner,160
185618,232886,4,really and really my 10 yo enjoyed helping rub the spices into the ribs it was a tad to sweet for my taste but everyone else really liked it and the basting sauce cooked up beautifully on the ribs,196
375264,1169937,5,refreshing and different i used chives and cilantro because they were the only herbs i had on hand,98
6653,897567,5,texture and perfect flavor,26
350863,303427,5,i these for a potluck picnic today and we all loved them i found the dough so to manage when rolling and cutting out the shapes i dusted the board with powdered sugar instead of flour to prevent crumbling and that worked very nicely too and the icing took to coloring perfectly the cookies and icing were and with a standard size cookie cutter i actually yielded just over 70 cookies from the you tremendously terrific,418
73440,197456,5,loved the taste and ease of this bread i decreased the butter to 2 tbs and found that to work well i did the first loaf with all purpose flour and then did a second loaf with 1 c rye flour and 2 c all purpose loved it even more i plan on trying other flours as i go along and maybe less white flour for a with ingredients i always have on hand,343
183399,1802442582,5,works as advertised cod came out moist and tender inside a perfectly fried outside just follow the directions,109
107668,213727,5,this for christmas gifts everyone loved it i did change a couple of things i used 1 2 vanilla pudding and 1 2 milk chocolate pudding and also used chocolate flavored coffee creamer doubled it once and then had to another double batch sent some over to a friend in iraq and he shared it with his buddies he got one cup and went back and there was no more left i guess i ll be sending more that way the kids loved it and the one comment i keep hearing back over and over is how creamy it is for posting,500
38465,404623,5,oh so and this is a keeper,26
102617,290298,5,im not usually a coleslaw fan but this is just so it for a bbq and even the kids ate it found it really to having never coleslaw before and i ll definatly be using this again and again kittencal,194
162379,1188379,5,very even dh liked it we through in some leftover brocolli and had a one dish meal out of it for sharing,104
30484,128470,5,incredible flavor and so to makes a lot invite over a crowd and prepare for many requests for the,97
52206,90966,5,the taste was i added chocolate chips to it even more spectacular the texture was a little bit chewy compared to other recipes however it was well worth it,155
13851,98394,3,authentic using salt free i need more spice tabasco or,54
46882,4601,5,i was very impressed with this i love the fresh vegetables and the black beans and cheese are the perfect filler fabulous,121
83189,220253,5,wow this tasted so authentic exactly like the greek restaurants in my town anyway it was a hit everyone loved it i will definitely use this again the only thing that i changed is that i used a little dill in lieu of the mint and just used garlic salt rather than going through the mortor and pestle process,306
50719,354307,2,these muffins were to and turned out well a for people who are a bit nervous about baking i found them to be more like cupcakes than muffins too sweet and a bit bland for my taste i m going to try blending a little wheat flour in next time and will reduce the sugar and vanilla by a fraction to see if i can them more muffiny,325
59863,863626,5,i this for a greek party yesterday where my mom brother and grandma were sharing their pictures from their recent trip to greece they said this was better than anything they tried in greece apparently the ones they tried had a lot more syrup so if you are going for really authentic maybe you should double the syrup but i ll continue making it just like the,358
440697,2002307207,5,this came out my first try i used half a papaya as the fruit and the habenero s i had grown myself will probably try a ghost pepper version next seeing as i have so many for sharing,181
27438,286710,5,meal tried it today being a single guy i was looking for something quick and for a better word cheap something that was in my cabinets all i had to buy was sausage me being a country boy i used down home sausage added some bellpeppers and garlic wow it s something i ll serve to my friends like i said quick filling and goes with beer,334
73825,41370,5,this cake is amazingly it s almost too to be carrot cake i followed the directions to the letter and had no problems at all there was plenty of frosting so i even had some left over to do some decorating with my only suggestion is to the day before and refrigerate if you have the time you so much lennie,304
50767,779641,4,fairly and the crescent roll breading wasn t quite for us might try making with pizza dough or pie crust the filling is very tastey and my family did like that for posting,171
15559,909116,5,i chocolate with chocolate chips and coconut and another batch with nuts and chocolate chips freezes well so a double batch also i substituted half of the oil with applesauce and they still came out moist and easiest and most and versatile ever you so much so sharing,267
60891,1485789,5,this is as close to the original as i can imagine a few tweaks tamarind paste is a lot easier to find i used sprigs of saffron rather than powder obviously you need more than one avocado i use 6 the honey is what makes it thicker than cf s but i like it i also don t warm in in the microwave all the dry ingredients esp the cashews go in a processor finally i tried oriental egg roll wrappers tyj which cook quicker and are crispier and only need water to glue it rather than egg,479
5029,993560,5,i ve been making this lemon bar for many years and always get high compliments on the texture flavor and appearance don t eliminate the lemon zest from these it totally makes the bar pop cookie bar worth 5 stars,211
32933,30355,5,this has been around our house for years it is everyone s favorite cake so simply to and just excellent after the cake is done and still warm we sift powder sugar over the top of the cake every bite will be eaten,212
40208,640199,5,this is phenomenal my dh has just started hunting again and i have been struggling to find recipes no one hunted in my family when i was little and so had no experience the whole family including a picky 9 year old gobbled it up i also forwarded this to a friend of ours whose family considers venison to be a staple and he was amazed at how perfect it was i followed the exactly and wouldn t change a thing it was to and the meat was mild yet flavourful,454
27171,224033,5,in my humble opinon this tastes exactly like the chili at the steak and shake we go to in a suburb of chicago i did take some advice here and increased the chili powder to 2 1 2 tablespoons and decreased the cocoa to 1 teaspoon and omitted the tomato paste entirely it was very my son 22 was drinking the juice from the bowl always a sign you so much for posting this i m thrilled i ve finally found a chili,407
97496,997403,5,these are cookies i misread the and only used 1 stick 1 2 cup of butter and we thought they were perfectly buttery for our tastes we also yielded about twice the amount given we will these again,194
117499,192670,5,i have these many times now and they are my husband has an egg allergy and it is so to have chewy moist cookies,111
371865,2001072752,5,love this stuff making it again today very close to original i m more keto so i use low glycemic brown sugar,108
35775,50994,5,gracious this is a really dish and to i used sausage everyone loved it for sharing this is a keeper,99
98845,201369,5,this was incredibly it for my parents husband daughter and friends and all the reviews were outstanding i marinated my steaks for 24 hours and followed all of the cooking instructions including using fresh herbs in the schmear fantastic,236
13234,270067,5,i these for a class assignment and they turned out everyone asked me where i found the trade secret although you shouldn t have heat oven 375f degrees if we have to refrigerate them d,183
16490,2002460667,5,i followed this except i doubled everything went very heavy on the ham almost triple the original my family are all big but healthy eaters then i had a thought again my dad especially being a big italian eater so i added a pack of idahoan 4 cheese mashed potatoes and the 2 cups of water it calls for to them some pepper and a little seasoning salt 45 mins on 400 in the oven so if you have left over ham or just want to try something different for a big family meal or a pot luck get together winner and so,507
138414,1802994461,5,i had a very lean 1kg topside roast i cooked in a heavy cast pot browned sides of roast in olive oil first then put sauce over instead of sitting on a rack sat roast on fennel bulb wedges cooked on stove on low heat with lid on was absolutely beautiful,252
26306,704153,5,i was skeptical having only fresh corn before but i needed a vegetable dish for a holiday gathering i added an additional bag of corn but did everything else the same this was a fantastic that traveled the hour to our hosts home well i d it again in a heartbeat,261
146410,313633,5,this was very my family says it is a keeper i wasnt sure if i should drain tomatoes i didn t thought it was for the,115
95048,2876443,5,i 039 ve never had a quot go to quot but i sure found it in this one this crust came out and browned perfectly,110
47111,25941,5,my mom loves raisin bread so i wanted to her a treat this is it turned out perfect you ml,89
69240,177638,5,this is excelent my husband loved it and i put it in my book of keepers,71
225771,524733,2,i had some trouble with getting this glaze to reduce i let it simmer for about 20 minutes and it still hadn t reduce i omitted the cayenne because of personal taste the chicken itself didn t really retain much of the orange flavour at all i don t think i would this again the flavour just didn t come through the way i hoped it would,333
205710,452576,4,but it seemed to be missing something,37
107664,297557,4,this has a comfort flavor i found it to be very salty when i it i wonder if there s a low sodium canned corned beef,115
39900,53378,5,this was a very and such a dinner for us i did find some fresh mozzarella and it melted very creamy i served this with salad bread and a bottle of merlot to pannan,163
214982,518636,5,this is a my family loved it everyone wants the this is now a staple in our diet,80
411565,2002564010,5,so this for a potluck and had none to take home this is a favorite at the holidays as well,90
51699,34206,4,i this exactly as written this is a very satisfying soup its not fancy but very substantial and perfect for a sunday night family supper what i like about this soup is that one can taste all the different ingredients the flavors are very clear and distinct and not muddled oh the leftover soup was even better too,313
25230,2001969808,4,i used a 12 piece muffin pan for 25 minutes to mini brownies and they turned into cupcakes they are cupcakes but not fudgey i guess the type of pan is really important,167
3568,831963,5,i used dried cranberries and bacon bits it was very to and very ithought some nutmeats would be a addition or fruit the nutrition facts are a little confusing first glance was that the salad had 1052 calories until i figured it was the total calories for 4 servings not 1 serving definitely will again,301
270022,320870,4,saw these as of the day and had to try them we really liked them dh thought they tasted like banana bread i as directed with the addition of flaked coconut chopped walnuts to the batter i did not use all of the crushed pineapple in the sauce cuz it i thought would ve been too much pulp not enough sauce next time i will double the sauce so that won t happen will most assuredly again,384
51104,2002822954,5,even without chilling dough first my daughter insisted on adding vanilla because she quot loves it quot and it turned out wonderful,131
16775,744939,5,as a feta cheese lover this spread was i scooped it up with triscuits and it was a snack,88
378778,1837360,5,ohhh my gosh i have been looking for this exact for years it was this i grew up with my grandma baking but after she died i just couldn t remember the you so much for sharing this i the cookies this evening for my family and they were a total hit just like i remembered them you again,284
107190,1208741,5,the only veggies i had on hand were onions and peas so thats all i used i thought all the flavors mixed well together i would this again especially for potlucks another to add to my favorites from kittencal everytime i meatballs i use the one you posted it s been about 3 years,277
16273,876513,5,i this following the crock pot directions and it turned out fabulously as suggested by other reviewers however i doubled the wine ommited the water and also doubled the flour and all of the seasonings in place of garlic powder i used fresh also i used one 14oz can of basil herb diced tomatoes and one 14oz can of fire roasted tomatoes as opposed to regular i served this with mashed potato tonight and it was simply fantastic i m definitely making this again,459
109764,632657,4,this is like a sweet spicy caramel corn i didn t have any tortilla chips on hand but it turned out anyway i think next time i d like to try it using corn pops puffed corn in place of the popcorn snack for movie night u,218
326783,1001408,5,wow the cookies are tender and full of flavor i really enjoyed them will definately them again,94
73362,1219343,5,these for a family get together on the 4th of july and did they go over like fireworks i my own meatballs cocktail size 5lbs worth and every single meatball was eaten i couldn t have asked for a better outcome kittencal,219
56744,421511,5,i had some leftover dried cranberries to use up and i love oatmeal raisin cookies when i saw this i knew i would love it they are every similar to oatmeal raisin cookies just w cranberries the cookies are moist and chewy on the inside and just a bit crispy around the edges so much for posting p4,296
252766,759481,5,me and my boyfriend loved it i cooked the noddles and added all the ingredients and lined a pan with some partially cooked tater tots with red peppers hot peppers and green peppers on top of the tater tots and than i added the tuna tuesday and baked it for 20 minutes it was,274
142212,176160,5,i was out of bacon so i added a couple drops of liqiud smoke to give it the subtle smoky flavor the bacon would have given it this is an outstanding,148
13584,1013852,5,i consider myself to be a grilled cheese expert and this is my new favorite way to prepare them instead of mixing the mayo in with the cream cheese i spread the mayo on the outside of the bread which makes it fry up a lovely golden brown i will be making this many more times,275
153579,362892,5,i really wanted to this but didn t have the dijon mustard or the tarragon i used spicy mustard a dash of dry mustard instead and added some grated carrot just for color and vitamin a for sharing,194
33919,2934118,5,so i it healthier by removing soup entirely and replacing with greek yogurt used 4 torn up tortillas added rotel tomatoes and black olives into the bean and beef mix low fat cheddar omg yum and satisfying,204
44291,56002,5,we really enjoyed this casserole with a roast last night it in the morning and cooked with the roast very filling but a change from mashed for posting,150
120933,225082,5,just bought an electric griddle and wanted to pancakes there are a lot of pancake recipes on zaar but i m glad i went with this one i ve never pancakes from scratch before this was a one to start with i altered the a bit by using 1 4 c oatmeal 1 4 c a p flour 1 2 c whole wheat next time i ll use only wheat flour i believe they will still be light,348
184692,544373,5,i used a carrot cake mix which saved my knuckles on the shreader ha ha ha increased the pineapple to 1 1 4 cup decreased the cinnamon to 3 4 tsp and omitted the nutmeg the carrot cake mix has spices in it already and added 1 cup of dark raisins my family went nuts the pineapple mayonnaise and raisins this the easiest moist cake i have ever only bummer is i could not add the nuts since i am allergic but other than that my family had only one other complaint i did not a back up they ate the first one so fast,511
45809,308474,5,this is follow the and don t overcook the chicken and you will be met with smiles and requests for seconds my 4 and 6 year olds even gobble this up so much,155
54257,2002321656,5,i have many a meatloaf in my life and by far the best i top the meatloaf after saucing with bacon why you ask because bacon makes everything better,147
214118,2693929,5,to with kids put the cheerios in ziploc baggies and let the pre schoolers crush them healthy alternative tasted and even picky eaters tried them tried to put coloring in them to them pink for valentines day but they came out brown inside after baking we put some colored sprinkles on top what kid can resist sprinkles,317
112979,289109,5,i was surprised to get so many compliments on the salad it was a hit i didn t add any of the meat i think it was the dressing and the crispness that everyone liked we ll be making it again,188
52782,421027,3,this is a i was a little nervous about the cumin since i haven t had much luck with it in other recipes there was no need this is a way to sneek in some zucchini with those picky eaters,185
72069,1800992,5,i was interested in this because i wanted something i can for a group that was relatively healthy based on the other reviews i pounded and cut the chicken into medallions and sauted in a little olive oil on the stove i used two chopped onions and three red peppers while i had the peppers in the pan i added some cayenne pepper as well as pimenton once i added everything to the processor i used the whipped cream cheese but used fage total 0 yogurt in place of sour cream i had roasted a head of garlic and added numerous cloves 6 to the mix i processed for several minutes and while i didn t quite achieve the pureed sauce i was hoping for i did get it to the point where it had a bit more texture than pureed so it didn t look too chunky as one review stated i mixed the chicken and sauce together serving it with mushroom ravioli over a bed of sauted arugula it was for a potluck i might try slicing the chicken breasts and thinning the sauce a bit,952
19538,2500830,3,my meat was burned and dry the cook time is too long try 40 50 minutes as other reviews have said also i think a smaller pan size would help it from drying out and for a meatier base under the tater tots it would also help to a tighter row of tots over the top if there were not so much real estate that needed covered,318
82533,348174,5,i added a little garlic and onion to the olive oil and sauted them before adding the snow peas and yellow squash i took the leftovers to work the next day to warm in the microwave for lunch everyone commented how the dish looked,228
450560,2002566509,1,so disappointed thanksgiving day flop i always look forward to making this tiramisu for special occasions years ago i found this online and printed it when i couldn t find the print i looked it up and found it here however this is wrong although too late to save my dessert i ve located the original print it calls for a half cup of espresso not 1 5 cups of espresso soooo sad,376
214998,168509,4,very flavorful pasta we liked it i mixed the leftovers with some vegetables for a lunch,87
84566,258610,5,absolutely my wife and i are absolutely addicted to them used 2 jars of grape leaves ran out and bought 4 more to use later we just can t stope eating em covered with egg lemon sauce mmmmmm mmmmmm,196
51209,324677,5,excellent dough i did not use accent or onion powder though a meat lover s version with crumbled itlian sausage canadian bacon and pepperoni will again,151
30117,94600,5,if your like your chili really spicy this is not the for you for the rest of us however this is a and incredibly use of leftover turkey to low in fat reading earlier reviews i had a can of green chilies i was going to add but i tasted before i did so and found the cumin and cayenne were just right for my taste i simplified matters even more by adding one can of chicken broth one can of cannellini beans very,410
31927,544754,4,i used a tbsp of filling for each wonton but next time will use much less because they were a bit too rich i will probably use a tsp or less for each rangoon next time and omit the salt,185
155021,158049,4,a slight adjustment after boiling them as directed i first tossed them into the sauce and let them marinate for a few hours before broiling them then just before serving i tossed them again in the sauce,202
46580,28941,5,i this the other day and hubby said that i can this anytime it was his favorite even over my banana chocolate chip bread i followed the to a t except i added an additional jar of cherries the only problem i had was the cherries sinking to the bottom i plan to per fect that in the next batch which will be in the next few days i can t freeze a loaf they don t last long enough theresa for posting this one,405
403733,2379835,5,this was i d bacon wrapped seasoned filets mignon and then realized i had no charcoal for the grill horrors this is texas after all that s a capital crime here had no idea how to do them in the stove oven this method turned out a rare but seared juicy steak without making it dry or chewy or otherwise wasting this prime cut of steak 2 minutes per side searing time 7 minutes bake time plus the resting time was perfect wish i could have browned the bacon better and all my texans were happy you,495
15145,122879,5,i had all the ingredients for this plus a gummi kit i got at a craft store so i was able to compare the quality of each and this is hands down better than the more expensive mixes or kits in the stores the mixes don t as much and the quality of those is pretty poor those gummies ended up sort of sticky gooey and hard to get out of the molds in one piece these taste exactly like the storebought readymade gummi things and much easier to set in molds oh one thing the states that the sugar free jello flavors shouldn t be used not sure why because i up a couple batches of those as well and it worked wonderfully perfect for a diabetic that doesn t want to pay an arm and a leg for candies also cuts down the calories considerably,731
116989,1179016,5,these are the first homemade cupcakes i ve ever and they turned out perfect i left out the cinnamon and nuts and frosted them with cream cheese frosting and they were i these for the guys at work and they couldn t get enough of them i would recommend making these in a heartbeat,278
375603,1230562,5,when you say quot corn chips quot my husband thinks fritos so that 039 s what he bought instead of tortilla chips it pretty much tasted like home chili cheese fritos once we added the spices and cheese and it was very next time we 039 ll it with tortilla chips to see which version we like better but this will definitely be added to our repertoire,348
111734,938290,5,fantastic i added peperoni personal love and that was it the thing disappeared faster than rain drops in tucson excellent and for posting it,140
172253,730986,5,wow charlotte these wonderful biscotti for zwt4 i did two batches one where i followed the exactly and one where i successfully substituted the sugar with splendar and left 1 3 of the hazelnuts and 1 3 of the chocolate in chunks mixing them in at the end both versions was gone in matter of hours you so much for posting,320
92204,461886,5,my aunt got this and now it is the like the best meal she makes it is so i love it take it from an eleven year old who knows,124
110548,60650,5,if anyone wants the real skyline chili it s very to get instead of taking the time to follow this cooking time is 2 3 hours on a very low temperature i live in ohio and it s sold already pre straight from skyline in grocery stores you can also buy it in flavor packets that has the complete package of spices minus the hamburger onion spaghetti and beans you can add that when your sauce is finished i always buy the packets which makes around 2 2 1 quarts i then freeze the sauce and pull out a container when ever i want skyline chili i then add the spaghetti onion beans and of course hot sauce on top of the cheddar cheese,626
149570,360119,5,the pink stuff is what my kiddoes call this it is a must or thanksgiving just isn t thanksgiving,96
47077,124268,5,this is excellent no need to buy from store anymore i just need to remember to this in advance so it has time to develop all the flavors,136
87879,1345244,3,very cute and fun to with my son for easter however we weren t too crazy about the taste a little too sweet i think won t be making them again but they were fun to once and for some cute photos as we them,204
125195,52607,5,so funny finding this i have been craving pea salad saw pea salad at the deli in the market was going to buy but had a second thought as i didn t know what could be lurking in their salad came home and found your yum i cut the down for 2 by eye balling it i didn t have sweet relish so i used hot dog relish which took care of the sweet relish and the mustard i used extra sharp chedder cheese i didn t add the sugar as the peas were very sweet i didn t add the seasoning salt but wish i could have hubby is on a salt free diet for the 0,537
71106,336790,1,i cooked as instructed the breading burned and i had to shake the way too much onion and parm cheese off the top turned out very dry will not be making again,157
154424,939002,3,this was a i used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and cut the potatoes to shorten the cooking time i will these again,120
26110,2001589447,5,to in the processor and they turned out perfectly the directions were spot on follow them to the letter,103
61081,19129,5,fabulous i ll be giving these this christmas,44
198,372223,5,when i visited china i ate a lot of hot and sour soup mostly because i could be more sure of the ingredients this is the closest i ve found to the taste of the soup there better than any restaurant soup i ve tried i it with extra garlic chile mix and no meat only problem is i haven t found dried black fungus maybe it would be even better,339
41190,43846,5,i this last night for dinner and got 5 stars from my husband i used the for 2lbs of boneless skinless chicken breast but added a bit more cayenne because we love the heat i put it all in a ziploc bag and marinated for 3 hours then baked it for 30 minutes at 350 it came out perfect you,285
69173,1343378,5,this is an excellent full of flavor these meatballs melt in your mouth i will them again and again for sharing this it s a keeper,129
428389,1813790,5,loved this and solely by mistake i added ground onion not garlic i took off what i could but left the rest and it was will totally this again,141
61366,2001143129,5,this is the perfect peach cobbler i this and it lasted less than two days in our house the tapioca is what makes it along with that dash of fresh nutmeg my husband asked when i was going to it again within a day or two after it was gone and he never does that i m off to another one,282
32614,139626,5,another way of making these are use lemon cake mix and after cooled icing with lemon ready icing you talk about awlsome they are those are the favorite at my house you caneven sprinkle while icing is still soft i tell you this is the only way to cookies anymore,261
59673,228760,1,i 8 cups and the buttercream never firmed up it took 20 minutes to turn warm not hot not 5 minutes as stated it had the taste and consistency of marshmallow fluff even after chilling and rewhipping,197
475970,2001359110,5,this is excellent i add julienne peeler d carrots for some color and sweetness and subbed green papaya for banana flower once and it was dressing is perfect balance of fishy and limey and sweety and spicy,204
51003,1348917,5,i think i forgot to give this stars on my previous review 5 stars for sure,74
82418,884404,5,it was the best,15
213659,1862011,5,short sweet you deserve an award for this marinade wow weeeee have used this every single week never gets old yum yum yum,121
85858,869356,5,very because of lack of some things i used mayonnaise and cracker crumbs instead of bread crumbs and coated in panko before frying,130
221743,2557090,5,this is i altered it a little a little extra lemon juice fresh garlic instead of powder add cilantro and potatoes in the bottom of the pan my husband loved it and my son a very picky two year old asked for seconds and then thirds totally and fun to this is going on the permanent list of recipes,295
74275,2442652,4,i this last night and it was i did however add some kale red pepper flakes garlic chives and a little bit of bacon this is a base that you can add whatever it is that you and the fam will enjoy next time im thinking of adding italian sausage for posting this vina,263
142323,258069,5,this was an excellent company meal to serve for a vegetarian couple they loved it the flavor was fantastic and every bit was gone i used vegetable stock in place of the water and added a little extra based on the comments here a salad and a loaf of crusty french bread for a meal very healthy and it s a keeper,310
43008,904483,4,i have to agree with the last reviewer clams are not quahogs one has a soft shell while the other has a hard shell different flavor and meat take it from me 14th generation rhode islander rhode island quahog chowder has a clear broth this is a very clam chowder though i will try it with clams jelly,299
285900,2861080,5,this is perfect i always use it and it has always come out it is and and makes the perfect homemade gyros i usually caramelized onions and or use tomatoes and lettuce along with traditional homemade tzatziki sauce either way everyone loves it,242
81419,1282271,5,i used vegetable stock and 1 2 cup red wine in place of the water added garbanzo beans along with the cannellini beans this was by far the best soup i have tasted in a long time if not ever plus it s so that we will be a winter staple in my house,246
106888,298979,5,sue i have been looking for something to do with winter squash this was fantastic i didn t have the turban so i used a buttercup squash and i used maple flavored sausage the turban must have a thicker rind because it fell apart and i just mixed it in a bowl and put it in a small cassarole i did everything else the same you again i definetly will this again bonnie,365
57023,48920,4,i was looking for a spinach pie my mom used to and this came close it could have been a bit creamier filling and i think she must have added more spices next time i ll add some half and half and a bit of nutmeg and hot sauce it is a pretty dish that reheats well in the microwave,279
33598,42586,5,i this for my husband and his coworkers for breakfast i did not have a 9 inch square so i used a 9 inch round because of the pan difference i did not have enough batter to layer properly so i placed the batter on bottom then the berries then a double batch of the crumb topping i used frozen defrosted and drained mixed berries this produced results and i will be making this often,381
35813,1802922406,5,cookie and best of all they 039 re very to this as is is definitely a keeper for sharing it,91
38379,205832,5,excellent dish used gound turkey and turned out fantastic everyone in the family enjoyed it i wouldnt change a thing,116
267734,349470,5,i loved it the kids loved it even better i the second one with cubed ham may try some hollandaise sauce with it next time very and very,135
690,689750,5,i really like garlic bread and kind of hooked up to i only use dried thyme and don t put the cheese also i put it in the oven without wrapping until it is well toasted and when i don t have italian bread i simply cut pita bread into wedges and use it instead it works too,271
375481,1800077107,3,this is really close to the one i normally use so i tried it out these taste wonderful but i must say that even after chilling the dough overnight even these cookies are way too flat its almost like they melt maybe its because i used butter but it does say margarine or butter i was a little aggravated because i usually the best pb cookies i think i will add less shortening next time flavor a 5 appearance a 2,411
372852,2000948,5,i this dressing today everything was going fine it tasted so until i added the ginger the fresh ginger i had expired so i decided to use dried instead but i never thought to find out the conversion between dried and fresh big mistake it turns out 1 tbsp fresh ginger 1 8 tsp ground ginger so i had used over 16 times the correct amount wow was is smelly and disgusting and i m someone who loves the taste and smell of ginger word to the wise always check coversions i will definetly try again soon and post another review i hope it turns out right this time,557
485821,2000306284,5,hey for refreshing my memory haha i had never used the oven method amp wanted to check to sure i wasn t forgetting anything a bunch amp merry christmas,151
13639,691937,5,i too liked the idea of making a pecan pie without the corn syrup the first time i this i follwed others suggestions to lower the butter to 1 2 cup and the brown sugar to 1 1 2 cups and up the pecans to 2 cups chopping the pecans in my proceesor left me with everything from crumbs to chunks of nuts covering the entire pie for the first 15 minutes as another reviewer suggested was a idea in the end i thought my first pecan pie tasted altho a little liquidy which repaired itself by sitting in the frig the second time i it i cut the brown sugar down to 1 cup and the eggs down to 2 and broke the pecans in half by hand it was a little bit liquidy but not much and the pie was still sweet enough that nobody missed the extra sugar and they all thought it was ann,764
27208,56176,5,this is the best to with wonderful results i added chopped onion to the gravy and may add mushrooms next time i fix it i can hardly wait till then,146
42292,2001377584,5,i used a dutch apple bread that i found the for on this site because the bread is already sweet i didn t use a lot of sugar but i did add a bunch of cinnamon since we all love cinnamon i had to increase the eggs because it didn t fully cover the bread so it took a lot longer to cook it but everyone loves it i will definitely this again,337
33752,48956,5,this was so to and as as anything i ve tried at the restaurant you mizznezz,75
36833,37713,5,love it love it love it i added some mini chocolate chips and the kids flipped i love these shack cakes that do not require frostings,133
78693,246145,2,this was just ok the popcorn ended up soggy and never crisped up properly,73
67964,748151,5,this is very to and has a very result the only difficult part for me was straining the horchata through the cheesecloth other than that i would recommend this to anyone,168
135426,726534,3,this was perfectly fine but nothing special i ve been catching cooking and eating trout for years and to me there was too much work getting all the ingredients together there are much easier recipes out there that taste better i followed the exactly except i used schiracha hot sauce instead of tabasco also i cooked it on my george forman grill since it was too cold outside to use the grill it would probably be much better on the outdoor grill but i probably won t try it again,480
6670,36690,5,specially with the orange rind to loved it,42
31901,1298498,5,this was inexpensive and really this is going to be one of my staples,69
18817,545717,5,so and crunchy a dream come true crunchy and very i 039 m really impressed with the taste and hope everyone will try this fantastic,131
292578,629313,5,i this last weekend and everyone really enjoyed it even my mother who is known for her spaghetti sauce i m making it again today but didn t have crushed tomato sauce so i threw in some barilla jarred sauce along with the fresh onion garlic black pepper and we ll see how it turns out for posting,295
25587,1681053,5,omg this is bomb my kids even loved it saved,44
225349,649153,5,i served this over baked potatoes,33
111360,398333,4,sure you are using fresh corn for this,38
18947,104827,5,if you are thinking like what i was and are a little cautious about the cottage cheese all i can tell you is try it it is the best cornbread i have ever had very moist my family loved it this is how i am going to mine from now on,229
51405,335571,5,oh wow oh wow these are the best cinnamon rolls i have ever had i them regular size and so it 24 cinnamon rolls did i mention that these are the best i have ever had they are these cinnamon rolls you will not regret it,218
87420,2002003666,5,this is a i took the suggestion of another reviewer and sliced the tenderloin into about 1 inch medallions when done and let them lay in the gravy definately a keeper,166
32317,846893,5,we really only need 1 2 of the dressing,39
340621,421546,5,after a few less than stellar attempts i think i ve mastered this with a few minor adjustments i found 6 1 2 cups of flour produced dry dough and adjusted to 6 cups i also upped the yeast to 1 1 2 teaspoons using rapid rise yeast having read the reviews i also lowered the baking temp to 400 f my latest and best batch consisted of 5 cups of bread flour and 1 cup of whole ground flaxseed meal the loaf was wonderful and heartily enjoyed by my family i may try baking at the original 450 f to achieve a crisper crust but the interior was absolutely perfect for helping me achieve breaddom in this lifetime,605
33919,2529671,4,i basically think this is a flawless 5 star but am deducting one star because it 039 s high in fat and low in vegetables my toddlers enjoyed it too,147
10331,961554,4,bread was pretty the bread was soft and like another reviewer said the crust was very crusty i have a zo bread machine i will try it in my breadman to see if it is better,170
54677,485151,3,this was alright it was a change of pace for breakfast the kids ate them ok but i don t think they ll request them again my sons also tend to like their eggs scrambled so that could be part of the problem i might try to this again for my husband to see what he thinks,267
37355,1381618,5,i don t have to try this to say it s i know it s because i ve been eating and making the same eggrolls give or take a few ingridents for almost over 10 years these are by far the best eggrolls you will ever eat every time i it for someone new they say the same,260
333876,798119,4,only the chicken but this is a chicken the chicken came out very moist,70
57062,188918,4,very and very to,16
106251,178742,5,oh oh ohhh just took out the oven and omg it is soooo i followed directions exactly but i wanted to do as other reviewers suggested and toss cauiflower and turn heat down to 350 and cook for another 30 minutes but nooooo husband took out oven for me and started to eat it and couldn t stop and said he can not imagine how it would taste better than it already does by adding another 30 minutes so i left it as is and totally agree wit him that s a first and i would not adjust a thing for this i love zaar aka com og and of course i took a picture to post here,560
84030,1244621,5,my family really enjoyed this meal it is so but has flavor we did not do any of the optional toppings and we still enjoyed it,125
359833,586469,4,i the tzatziki cucumber sauce which was a lot of work even for a small amount this is also a lot of work for one serving having never the cucumber sauce and also never tasted hearts of palm i was a little nervous about how this would turn out or taste i did like the taste but the red cabbage color leached out into the egg and shrimp and didn t look very appealing so my picture would not do justice to this i would this again as it is a healthy salad and flavor,463
56906,350627,5,my husband inhaled this dish i it with whole wheat penne red pepper flakes instead of cayenne and added about 1 2 cup of sun dried tomatoes it for a quick and pretty healthy weeknight dinner,190
94907,70793,5,outstanding i this for family the other night and got rave reviews preperation was very and i am already having requests to it again,132
129716,683464,5,this is the best for rice krispy treats i use kroger brand cereal and marshmallows i always double the it takes 2 10 oz bags of marshmallows and a whole 12 oz box of cereal and 1 stick of margarine i spray a jelly roll pan with non stick spray and then press the mixture and flatten it then let it set up and then cut into squares and devour the pan,349
53506,615142,5,this was an excellent cake i it in a bundt pan and it turned out wonderful,74
54257,344700,5,this is an the only things i did differently is i used 2 lbs ground beef and 1 cup italian seasoned bread crumbs it took a little longer to cook about 20 extra minutes it was wonderful and we will be having this again soon,222
251332,2000196224,5,much easier than the network recipes although i 039 m sure they are also was afraid of overcooking the eggs directly on the stovetop but no problem just use your lowest heat burner and set to medium low perfect hollandaise it was a hit,235
519975,1803513482,5,fun activity to do with the kids,32
325899,2619604,5,wanted to use up some things i had in the house typed in ham amp asparagus amp this came up i didn 039 t have the pepper so used onion instead it was my husband loved it too so it is one i will again,199
474520,2204499,5,i these potatoes to go with a roast i in the crockpot served with some steamed green beans and yeast rolls the potatoes were the hit of the dinner i ll definitely these again,174
84292,1978307,2,i am not sure what happened but this turned out awful i as written but something just didn t quite mesh taste wise i will try it again but i am not sure how to fix this to it better,181
82925,306193,5,quite i used 2 apples and all of the crumble i think i ll it again tonight this time i let stell cut oats sit in warm melted butter for a portion of the day very but i enjoy any butter brown sugar oat meal combo,211
62016,197411,5,super dessert my kids love it and it s a hit for kindergarten snack time,72
25459,55966,4,these tasted mine didn t rise as well but i think i overworked them because i kept thinking the dough needed to be drier pretty sure now it was fine without any extra flour and extra kneading,191
187773,563640,4,combination but would remove the seeds from the jalapeno next time found it too dominant,88
20763,222076,5,the only difference between this and the famous betty crocker posted by kim dee and silent cricket is the amount of flour this one calls for 3 1 4 cups and betty s calls for 3 cups everything else is the same more flour results in a crispier cookie so for those who prefer soft cookies go with betty crocker s my dh and i prefer crispy cookies so we love this bev,363
222469,98722,4,another of my favorite type of lots of flavor for not a lot of work somehow i managed to run out of mayo so i used a mild mustard which worked out fine this is likely to become a staple in our house,198
179949,364685,5,very salad i cut up the zucchini and green beans before leaving for work in the morning and in the evening it only took about 10 minutes to get it to the table i added a little extra parmesan and i used dried basil instead of fresh i ate mine over a bed of baby spinach while dbf ate his plain we both enjoyed it immensely and i will be making this again,354
218229,1474753,4,it was very we added one can of 10oz of rotel thats all i had we put a spoon full of sour cream on top very on day 2 we warmed it up and i added a big spoon full of rice in bottom and laddled the soup over the top was even better that way,238
299795,923645,2,wow i really didnt like this i it exactly according to the and there was waaay too much mayo,92
16570,58570,5,this is very and i will certainly it again soon,47
17153,205783,4,i this with organic broad beans out of my box this week the flavour was fantastic and the yoghurt garlic really complimented the beans evie,139
19020,29166,5,and tasting what a combination for the wonderful dana,53
41755,2002153689,5,my family raves over this dish top of the line fast and so much,63
346583,419081,5,this was i did add a bit more pepper at least 1 2 tsp the dough was a bit thick and it only 8 waffles,101
184247,31635,5,and reviewed for zaar world tour 4 this is a minestrone i had never thought to put prosciutto in but it really the dish followed the as written and it is a definite keeper,171
126365,535512,5,the 5 stars is from my toddler and preschooler my normally picky eaters finished the batch in one sitting i ll them again for the kids i like the corn taste in my mind they need onion powder or herbs or something but it a start i had a wee bit of batter left when i had filled two pans so i added milk to the batter and corn pancakes i found using my fingers to pat them flat was easiest way the crackers aren t crispy but they remind me of the crisp edges of cornbread when its in a cast iron skillet they do crisp up somewhat after the full 30 minutes of cooling directed in the,580
284635,625885,2,this turned out really weird for me it was really runny and i added more sugar and cracker crumbs and it didnt turn out i cooked it for a 1 2 hr so i am not sure what happened i might try again,193
17778,139432,5,my family loved these even those that don t normally eat okra you for posting,77
15937,219291,5,fantastic cake i am always looking for oat recipes and this one is a keeper i wouldn t change a thing perfect cake,114
113172,195750,5,my kids this by themselves one afternoon they ate it for what seemed like hours i tried it and was shocked because it tastes exactly like my mom s homemade ice cream who knew,174
70534,166850,5,this is it s also so to i used extra lean ground sirloin to cut down a bit of the fat in the meat and i added 2 small cans of sliced mushrooms other than that i the exactly as directed and it turned out fantastic i tripled up the and served it for a party and ended up giving the to 5 or 6 people hubby and kids also love it it s a definite keeper o thanx ratherbeswimmin,371
157732,214665,5,this was a soup however i used ground chicken breast instead is a keeper,72
97496,2002457207,4,i tried this with a friend and she s really cool and a cook and i d like to think we did a decent job we doubled the batch and ended up making way too much cookies and it might ve tasted a little weird but they were very for the,228
9160,2001346003,5,best rice pudding ever my goal was to find a that was as as kozy shack which is all natural amp very this with some adjustments i surpassed my goal the 1st time i it i added one egg beaten with a little heavy cream at the same time as i added 4 cups of whole milk amp i stirred in a pat of butter at the end too i cooked it for about 30 minutes amp i took it off the heat when it was still a little more liquidy than i thought it should be because the warns not to overcook in big letters amp i got scared lol it was very delish the 1st time just not quite as thick as i like it but it was still amp pudding y the sweetness was perfect with 1 2 cup sugar too the 2nd time i it i used 1 cup rice instead of 3 4 so it took more water to cook the rice i used mostly 2 milk with a little whole milk cuz that s what i had on hand amp i used 2 eggs beaten with about 1 4 cup of heavy cream i used 3 4 c sugar this time since i increased the rice amp heavy cream i also added the butter at the beginning when i was cooking the rice instead of stirring it in at the end to help the flavor cook into the rice more oh amp i doubled the vanilla too i also cooked it for longer by not starting to time the 30 min until the milk amp everything started simmering well it was absolute perfection the 2nd time i always sprinkle cinnamon on the top after it chills in the fridge it is the most even better than kozy shack i use medium grain white rice called calrose to this which makes a creamier pudding than long grain rice this is definitely my go to rice pudding with the adjustments i i think adding eggs makes it tastier but it s still without them,1638
34775,168255,5,wow now i know what all the fuss is about my only problem was that the cornmeal was too gritty i ll have to look for something that s ground finer,146
80851,185721,5,i these for a memorial day party because 2 people who were diabetic were coming i substituted real whipped cream for the whipped topping i them sugar free for the diabetics and i used regular pudding and whipped cream with sucanet for the others i varied them using different flavors of pudding for the fillings and used whipped cream with either sucanet or equal everyone at the gathering raved over these and 2 people asked for the the sugar free ones didn t taste sugar free they tasted like they had sugar in them one diabetic mentioned that every time he eats a sugar free desert it tastes sugar free but that these didn t i d definitely recommend this as one of the best i am making it again tonite but i am going to use the eclair bottoms to strawberry shortcake,769
18583,327989,5,has anyone tried to double this will it still work,50
223724,588074,5,absolutely i ve tried many banana muffin recipes and this proved to be the best yet the muffins were large fluffy and very moist as stated i substituted the pecans for chocolate chips and doubled the it worked perfectly not too sweet not dry or flavorless for a i will definitely use it again,292
103461,220062,5,very i this with chicken and chopped the chiken real fine like the ground beef our friends don t eat beef so we tried chicken i have had this both ways and we were pleased with the out come it was almost hard to tell it was chicken over the taco seasoning i perfer beef but it s to know this taste excellent both ways i also only put half the beans in personal perfrence,370
38137,1492648,4,i didn t have 6 8 hours and needed to cook it on high so i microwaved the ribs first for about 11 minutes and then put them in the crockpot for about 4 hours i did everything else as listed and the is but,204
25492,35714,5,i this for a gathering over the weekend let me tell you if i wasn t already married i could be easily by friday with all of the proposals i got keep that in mind single girls this was an awsome snack cake and i intend to it alot in the fall when the macs are fresh yum,268
77053,195229,5,to sauce i used mango chutney as i had no jam and it tasted a veg side dish like spicy green beans would go well,112
82121,1141377,5,i really enjoyed this i this for an appetizer for my family dinner everyone enjoyed the flavor of the stuffing i used celery instead of endive only to save money but the celery worked very well with the stuffing,211
25825,149426,5,you so much for posting this my mother used to it for me for my bd every year the only difference is that she would cover it with whipped cream then decorate it with glazed strawberries and mint leaves the whipped cream hides the bumpiness of the cake and makes it look even more beautiful i can t wait to it,308
226505,118840,5,i too tried this one night when i had very little on hand we actually prefer this to ground beef when we re using store bought sauce i cut the sausage into smallish chunks and brown it in a little vegetable oil before adding the sauce to heat through it s actually quite,270
15996,444597,5,wow what can i say as soon as i this sauce my kids want to dip the chips into it so far i haven t been able to try it with chicken or pork because its gone as soon as its for a brill sauce and for keeping my family happy,220
212632,538524,5,oh wow my friend and i loved this shot the cinammon such a delish difference it left the after taste of a chocolate cake we both loved this shot and couldnt get enough of it so much calee,187
70501,168753,5,one of the better zucchini pancake recipes i have tried i substituted some of the flour with breadcrumbs to them more crispy loved the addition of parmesan cheese for sharing your,179
46112,417332,5,awesomely them in my mini muffin pan and topped them with cream cheese frosting took them to a new years eve party very big hit you,131
69627,357554,4,pretty i added a clove of garlic with the onions and 1 2 cup white wine for some of the water dh did not know i used a mix,122
76930,156653,4,very i tasted the sauce for the pasta before i dumped it in and it seemed a bit sweet for us so i only added about 1 2 of it a little more soy sauce and some salt i only had time to marinate the chicken for about 35 minutes but it still tasted wonderful the chicken balanced out some of the sweetness of the noodles very well i will definately this again,354
75113,347233,5,i ll this again and again didn t have any broth but i used 1c water and 2 small packages of boullion powder as per instructions on boullion turned out perfect blend of lemon and spices not overpowering just you,210
263151,463763,4,this was really i used ketchup over the top of the meatloaf rather than the tomato sauce a meatloaf,99
74698,2760479,5,o man this was i usually have a bias towards recipes with such view ingredients but this was really definitely a keeper,119
92094,225096,5,another heatwimp here i used this to copy a sandwich i love from a restaurant where i live it s called kickin chicken you just take a cooked boneless chicken breast breaded or not dunk through the sauce place on a kaiser roll with medium thick slices of cucumber and ranch dressing you get the hot chicken the cool ranch and the cool crunch of the cucumber one of my favorite sandwiches,386
21564,1528901,4,i like thicker lima bean soup too and this as posted has too much fat here is what i did to improve the and not compromise taste one bit add two carrots diced and two stalks of celery diced to the water with the lima beans and onions i found i had to cut back to five quarts of water to accommodate all of the extra ingredients not a problem for someone who likes the soup thicker seven or eight medium potatoes diced are plenty grate two of the potatoes and add them after the broth has simmered for an hour let simmer for additional half hour and then add balance of potatoes along with the golden brown bacon nix the bacon drippings and flour as neither is needed could substitute mashed or coarsely grated cauliflower for flour if additional thickening is desired let simmer for an additional half hour add four cups of diced tomatoes canned will do for flavor and a bit of color two bay leaves 3 4 t thyme 3 4 t paprika 2 t lemon juice salt and pepper to taste and favorite flavorful hot sauce optional either continue to simmer for three to four additional hours until done stirring often and or adding additional water to avoid burning the ever thickening mix or remove contents from heat and transfer to 7 qt or 8 qt crock pot to finish soup at low setting for five to six hours add additional warm water prior to serving if somewhat thinner consistency desired okay to refrigerate broth overnight and then transfer to crock pot next morning with a little extra water to finish soup at low setting for six to seven hours if needed but wait till then to add lemon juice until ready to finish soup makes 14 to 16 hearty servings,1634
187822,663793,5,perfect this will be a component to a new culinary creation i am working on,75
77414,118239,5,this dish is it was so super cheap and quick to my husband flipped out i highly recommend this to everyone,106
197259,76574,5,soup taste to my liking i used dry wild mushrooms which i have from 2 years ago which i picked up in forest in europe i followed the exactly and i would not change a thing and tomorrow soup will be even better nitko,215
35813,496245,5,these cookies are i ve them several times since discovering the and each time i get reviews i only one change i substitute the raisins with craisins dried cranberries because i personally don t like raisins,206
23848,40016,1,the cookies were cakey in texture and did not have any cherry flavor,68
371510,171210,5,this is a i looked at others but they called for corn syrup which i never use or evaporated milk i didn t have any on hand i already had everything i needed for this and it was so to that my 11 year old dd it on her own we will definitely this again,249
77206,1800261548,5,this was i used heavy whipping cream with some water maybe 3 4 c heavy cream 1 4 c water forgot the onion so used onion powder didn 039 t add sour cream and didn 039 t add any extra water because i didn 039 t drain my spinach i also used less than a 1 4 c of parmesan but didn 039 t measure we both loved it,307
499698,2002467765,5,very just have to watch that the chicken doesn t get overcooked the is quite flexible regarding ingredients e g i like to add mushrooms on top,142
52199,90355,5,these were very i mixed the taco seasoning with olive oil instead of butter and i used hormel s real bacon bits i served them with sour cream next time i will try them with the salsa too for another nursedi rita,211
32405,235355,5,delish i left out the olive oil since i m on a super low fat eating program but even without it these were fantastic in fact i just realized i forgot to use the basil whoops but they were absolutely and i don t think they needed either the oil or the basil when i m eating normally again i ll try it with the oil and see if it s any better that way if so then i d have to give this 6 stars,389
29767,77984,5,absolutely fantastic my husband and i loved this i think this would definitely be a pot luck dinner taker or summer time picnic treat,133
158791,1709513,4,this dressing is very unique i liked it but the egg gave it a bit of an unusual taste i think next time i might add a clove of garlic to the dressing and some shrimp to the salad i think it would be excellent with the addition of some type of seafood,250
146036,299240,5,when i told dh we were having stuffed squash for dinner it was all he could do not to order pizza however he ended up eating half of it even my finicky 2 year old loved it although my notional 5 year old was less enthusiastic it did take a while to do all the chopping i did it by hand but the was very very otherwise and well worth they time,342
95569,448617,5,very i used the memphis barbecue sauce 99023 and wish i had leftovers i think that my husband wanted to lick the crock pot ok maybe i did too and try this barebecue sauce it is to die for,187
63017,1834576,5,i boiled my potatoes and eggs separately i m not a fan of celery so that was left out i use miracle whip french s mustard along with sweet gherkins even the pickle juice the white pepper is a change you still get the pepper flavor but it doesn t overwhelm the sauce i liked it so much i another batch of the sauce and blended it with egg yolks for my deviled eggs this one is a keeper,384
96154,377366,5,basic to add or subtract to according to personal taste perfect for leftover chicken to i love lemon amp dill the reason i tried,128
478869,2002850512,1,dough was a bit runny and i added 1 cup more flour overrally way too too sweet,78
106251,855206,5,my 8 year old son helped me this today for lunch he wouldn t normally touch this type of dish he loved it he ate every crumb out of the baking dish i think i ll this as a side dish with spaghetti,195
181786,282678,5,i used this marinade on some t bones i added some coarse ground black pepper and used shallots instead of onion the steaks were juicy and tender i brought them to room temperature before grilling and let them rest for a few minutes before serving they certainly did not have the texture of rubbermaid i actually tried your marinade before posting a review and i am glad i did this would a marinade for less expensive cuts of beef let s face it top cuts are not always in everyone s budget for sharing your dad s with us,519
67256,543953,5,i didn t realize i hadn t rated this yet it is a wonderful cake according to my roommates and boyfriend i ve been making it for them for a couple years now and it always disappears quickly not a fan of banana myself though,222
289329,868964,5,this was an side dish during the day while cooking my kids thought i was making pizza because of the garlic smell but it is not as garlic strong tasting as it smells while cooking the true test was my picky kids they were of course reluctant to try but when they were finally convinced to taste they loved it for the is a keeper,328
222188,333545,4,tasting and to but very sweet,29
32105,685883,5,a co worker brought these in to our office she gave us the off the top of her head and they were so that i wanted to search online to find a close to compare with this is the exact one they were a piece of summer heaven and i am making them this weekend for a family potluck in hand for when they ask,300
121490,115088,5,this wonderful bread with your decadent strawberry butter is unbelievable omigosh love this was out of walnuts so subbed in pecans worked out just fine so much for sharing this,176
444807,740235,5,i loved this icing like cooks4 6 said i will use this base as my go to buttercream icing from here on out i also added 1 4 cup of crushed candy canes for sprinkling the rest over the top of my chocolate cupcakes mom s chocolate cupcakes by kmdipaolo 105594 the only change i because i was short on butter was to substitute half the butter amount with crisco per the conversion instructions on the jar not my fave to use shortening in icing but with the peppermint flavoring not a substitution that anyone could taste as far as i could tell i think it also was easier to pipe in fancy designs as i garnished each cupcake with a circular mint for the holiday party,662
30454,374974,5,this is the best ever i ve it so many times including a bridal shower and it went quick the sour cream sauce is what makes it now i m handing it out to everyone who asks and you can even substitute ground turkey for the burger a definite keeper,244
52779,242444,4,i this twice and sent it to my friend who also loved it i substituted in whole wheat flour for part of the all purpose flour and wheat germ one thing not to do do not throw in wheat berries to substitute for nuts as they will be way too hard had to throw that batch out,269
273482,1090806,5,we this tamale at a residential treatment center for teenagers this holiday season we it a group effort with over 15 boys multiplied the to 150 tamales they were wonderful the kids were amazed and had never eatten anything so yummmy even the picky ones the filling is outstanding we have been making the filling at hom just to have around for taco s and adapt as a green chile stew,381
66648,377039,5,very marinade tastes to do,26
134006,187955,4,i saw this the day it was posted and thought it sounded interesting i finally tried it today and found the muffins to be quite i wouldn t call them fudgy but they were nonetheless a quick that uses things always on hand for posting,231
74251,258223,4,i really liked this i think i will try the suggestion of adding other spices like ginger cinnamon and nutmeg along with the pepper a adult cookie but even my two granddaughters liked them and didn t realize there was pepper in them until i told them mary,254
99423,470111,5,pulled this off tonight without parmesan cheese too costly and hard to find in turkey and it still rocked i probably doubled the wine and used pure cream rather than 1 2 and 1 2,177
20431,1800615584,5,these are they are so and the aroma fills my kitchen with wonderful holiday scents took them to a dessert party and they disappeared before i set tray on the table they will become a holiday staple i increased the fresh ginger to 2 tablespoons as we like the taste,264
36984,2677355,5,oh man was this the only changes i were leaving the onion out due to an allergy and adding sliced mushrooms in the last step oh and i did add the potatoes after the first hour and wish i had added the carrots then as well but that 039 s just because i like all the veggies and soft i was worried the beef might overcook but it was perfect served with irish soda bread for a very filling meal will add to my regular rotation,423
37547,2001086817,5,these were they are so pretty you don t want to take a bite but so you just have to i did use all of the flour to form a ball of dough and followed all directions except that i did not feel the need to refrigerate because the dough was already to work with at 14 minutes they came out perfect and even stayed a little bit soft in the center you could only see a tiny bit of browning at the base i imagine that if you like a crisp cookie that you can obtain that by cooking longer as the outside was the consistency of lornadoon shortbread cookies i tried them both with and without the glaze because so many reviews said it wasn t needed i definitely like the glaze as i do like sweet without glaze is a mild sweetness but with is not overdone either i added about 1 2 tsp more water to the glaze easier to drizzle on overall i am extremely pleased with this and am already planning my next excuse to them so many compliments,925
22801,42231,4,very to prepare and i love that i thought the taste was little tangy i did use the full 1 cup mayo will cut back on that a little added a slight bit more parmesan as i had a little left in the bag and did not want to waste it served with bite sized bread i did added about 1 clove of minced garlic which i think only gave it a little kick,338
390131,801584,3,i know this from a visit to the restaurant 10 years ago but this was not quite the same the green onions were still raw and we did not think that they worked with the sauce it was a but the beef stock was to much and the sauce runny even tho we had it on the heat for 10 mins or more will look for another to try and get the taste we remember not bad but not as i remember worth trying tho used filets btw and ate it with fries and salad,437
230210,192957,5,very will again,15
202709,362038,5,i ve this multiple times but obviously forgot to rate it until now this is a dish my husband says it is one of his favorite dishes i we are able to stretch this to feed our family of 5 yum,188
30724,265102,4,we marinated these overnight and they turned out really tender because of the spices they chicken quesadillas yum,113
56969,606419,5,fantastic these for 4th of july bbq i used andoullie sp sausage instead of the bacon for a spice i also used homemade bbq sauce they were fabulous yum yum,154
57679,2000680185,5,sooo and sooooo if you like key lime pie you ll love this,57
96988,622829,5,this was i added some seasoning before putting in the crockpot then added the smoke flavor and let cook for about 6 hrs on high served it with mashed potatoes salad and corn with gravy from the broth in crockpot extremely,221
75280,246259,5,i used this for gourmet dinner night at the bakery that i work at and the results were wonderful no cracking of the cheesecake at all the only thing that i change was that i omitted cloves and only because i don t care for cloves the cheesecake was loved so much that i have received 25 orders and counting for this cheesecake for the thanksgiving holiday for a,361
10344,1016844,5,a perfect not too saucy and all the flavors are a crowd pleaser for sure,72
35132,402135,4,i formed these into patties and served in pita bread with tzatziki tomato red onion cucumber and feta cheese i didn t need the egg in the end they bound together just fine i bet these would be much better if i had a processor and could mince the onion grating an onion is horrible work and i always end up just chopping,319
83255,2335867,5,these were i took all of the reviews comments to heart and did one change i added 2 teaspoons of old bay seasoning to the cream cheese mixture was it ever with that seasoning added the entire plate was gobbled down quickly oh and i omitted the butter as suggested from one review and they did come out and crispy,312
88304,1880665,4,these were pretty i thought they needed a little something for more flavor though so i m going to play with it a little more oh and they were done almost over done in 20 minutes,177
3596,254899,5,really i used 1 2 whipping cream 1 2 skim milk also a little less cheddar cheese about 1 4 lb the soup was very thick but we liked it that way it a hearty meal,159
229106,2001641227,5,as someone who has chicken parm from scratch ughhh this is by far the next best thing waaaaay easier and kids love it too i ve also used the tyson chicken patties which is also and if i don t have mozzarella i really just throw whatever i have up there usually a cheddar monterey mix or something that i buy in bulk from sam s lol so glad others use the frozen stuff too what a time and sanity saver lol,403
71238,226417,3,it looked really until i read that it had 20 4 g of saturated fat possibly try to cut back on the 8 oz of butter,112
70026,330870,5,fantastic my fiancee and i tried this broth instead of our normal fondue broth to change things up a bit we both loved this broth so much and we agreed that it was so flavorful that we almost didn t need to use our dipping sauces we will definitely be using this again so much for posting it,291
52237,159740,5,wonderful to and scrumdilicious only change i was to up the garlic love that garlic served as a sude dish with baked flounder,125
7118,84196,5,loved it perfect texture just the right amount of sweet and i did dust mine with confectioners suger after it cooled only thing is all my berries went to the bottom of the pan don t know if they were suppose to do that or not but who cares eh still now i only have 20 more cups of blueberries to use up for the keeper,317
46501,606850,5,i wanted a to use my 4 grams of protein per 1 4 cup serving flour king arthur s sir lancelot high gluten flour that said only to use in abm because it s so tough to knead after 5 minutes of mixing i checked on this loaf i needed to add three more splashes of water but high protein flour does need more water after the additional water worked in i checked on it again by poking it the crucial water to flour ratio was right but i could also tell that this dough would be a beast to knead by hand it felt very tough and contrary this is due to the flour not the in fact when my dough cycle was over i told it to start over so the bread machine did the second kneading for me too yes the dough was that tough i was relieved that it rose well both times after the machine kneading i shaped it into a log and placed it in a stoneware french bread baker to rise once more then bake since the dough was so difficult i was pleasantly surprised at the final results the crust is chewy i could have softened the crust by letting it sit in the cooled oven overnight but my mom prefers chewy bread yet the bread is remarkably soft i think of french bread as being chewy all the way through and this isn t but the results are quite i suspect i could have had results closer to thicker crust all chewy french bread if i had put a pan of water in the oven while baking but then again this turned out so nicely i m not sure i need to mess with a thing,1436
30540,1317580,5,and i had no mushroom soup so i used chicken instead it was still fantastic i m a garlic fiend so i also added a fair dose of powedered garlic a fast cheap comfort fantastic if you ve had a rough day and want something but,222
104296,76007,4,this has a wonderful flavor but it was a little too dry for me maybe next time i ll add a little more milk or sour cream i will definately be making this again though for posting,178
16136,704545,5,perfect my fiance who loves his moms bread pudding but has never liked any of the ones i loved this so did i and i don t like bread pudding at all i left out the raisins as he doesn t like them i used crusts from like 5 loaves of bread that tend to just sit in the fridge because no one but me will eat the end of the loaves so it ended up being a mixture of white and wheat bread added a little bit more cinnamon and nutmeg to the top right before i put it in the oven i really liked the crispy top this is my new and i will definitely be making it more often,560
392409,2001133995,5,i a double batch of this mac n cheese for a group camping trip it was so i will definitely be keeping this for any other time i mac n cheese,140
22127,361170,5,this was so and absolutely i sauted the garlic along with the onions and i omitted the tomatoes dietary restrictions other than that i followed the exactly and my husband and i were so pleased with the results i ll be making this again soon,240
302975,237624,5,oh linda you saved my life tonight i was just dying for ab chocolate chess pie i went to my book and the little scrap of paper that held this magical was nowhere to be found ah luckily you have posted it here for us all now if we could just fast forward baking time you for sharing,281

20539,22922,5,very tastey i cooked them in the oven turned out,48
51371,437727,4,this was i can t personally say fantastic because i m not a fan of acorn squash others eating however enjoyed therefore 4 stars one adjustment due to travel time to and from work was that this cooked for almost 9 hours might ve a difference for previous reviewer s comment on turmeric as it seemed to work fine with my results for the post tish,344
54601,224033,4,let me say that i think this is a to try first because sweet potatoes are a healthier alternative to white potatoes and are often ignored except at thanksgiving second because it s an way to prepare them and who isn t looking for that i think it s a you try and it s certainly edible and then you tweak with a little more of this or less of that to your liking you kyjo i never would have thought of using the crockpot for this or using applesauce,447
37413,280716,4,i followed the directions exactly but for some reason the flat patties bulked up into thick burgers also the fat in the juices wouldn t blend in with the cornstarch so the gravy was a disaster i ll give it another try with some modifications,241
129926,2354478,5,i have just these tonight with refried beans and spanish rice i really liked them and plenty of leftovers for tomorrow my husband did not enjoy them as much as i who cares more for me tomorrow,192

67781,162155,5,whole family loves this pudding we definitely prefer chessman cookies over the typical nilla wafers i ve even just the pudding part and substituted a banana cream instant pudding for the vanilla and then served in it parfait glasses with a chessman cookie stuck in the top looked and still had the banana taste without the bananas i happened to be out out the time it was this stuff disappears fast chessman cookies don t get as mushy as vanilla wafers do this is a family favorite,481
27951,259021,5,these were i got about 70 sized ravioli s out of this batch definitely worth the work,85
190196,354689,5,we this just this afternoon and i wanted to review straight away so so really light fluffy texture chocolatey flavour and moistness i ll use this over and over and especially to offload my zucchinis into nita btw as described and baked in a springform tin 10 and used yoghurt for the buttermilk,294
108651,171063,5,my mom s co worker s mom this casserole and brought it to work one day my mom liked it and took a sample for me along with the it was rich and creamy and is my to go chicken casserole when i need something quick satisfying and this goes with mashed potatoes seasoned green beans a side salad and fresh rolls you kc cooker for sharing a classic,343
170033,183025,4,a i substituted brown rice earlier in the cookiing process and 100 grams of cheddar cheese cubes for added some richness,120
301677,1662334,5,used this as a base and added mashed potatoes slightly dryer than usual an extra egg grated cheddar cheese and seasonings dry parsley garlic onions and thyme used an ice cream scoop to obtain consistent portions and flattened lightly on top of very fine white cornmeal turned it over to add the cornmeal coating to other side had guests over and this as part of a brunch menu it was a hit with everyone,402
31515,30911,5,wow myrna this was absolutely i did not have a tenderloin on hand so i used a roast which i opened in half to apply the oj brown sugar ginger mixture tied it with string marinated overnight and baked in an oven bag till internal temp was 170 onions and glaze added such a yet somewhat gourmet touch a real keeper and one i look forward to impressing family and friends with,373
88743,100337,4,i this with italian sausage my picky grandson ate half of it leaving not enough for us i will double this next time a lovely way to use up the garden bounty,156

49172,449500,4,oh holy cow these are i them almost exactly as stated i used a sharp cheddar cheese and tossed in a dash of ground nutmeg and a dash of ground cloves even with that and a pinch and a half of salt these were but a little bland i may have to follow the suggestions of others i m planning on throwing in some diced jalapenos next time,331
367484,1242086,4,this was pretty i added a little more fajita seasoning mixed the rice in with the mixture then wrapped it in shells it was a hit with my family you,147
261634,378615,5,quick and what else can be said yum the whole family loved it,61
66408,31739,2,this was edible but we thought it was pretty blah not a keeper for us,69
25176,91867,5,yooper this was fantastic you so much for posting this the only 2 changes i added a little confectioner s sugar to the frosting and i used chocolate chips to garnish the frosting instead of almonds you you you,209
27084,40114,4,i tried it both hot and cold certainly not bad but it could do with some salt,77
49534,164914,5,wow i did change this up i used the base for a cookie dough but instead of the topping of cinnamon and sugar i used chocolate chips they were one of the best chocolate chip cookies ever the dough is so chewy and flavorful and very rich too my whole family loved these cookies,275
205890,347873,5,i probably underbaked mine slightly but they were still i reduced the amount of white sugar by half and added chocolate chips as another reviewer commented the peanut butter taste is subtle but they were perfect imo,215
250556,460034,5,perfect super and turned out i did it exactly as written,56
23821,2001625595,5,i ve these twice and i liked the results the second time i didn t add the cocoa to just peanut butter ones and it turned out fine for sharing,141
95416,175559,4,receipe for quick icing did find a little sweet seen your tip added 1 8 teaspoon of salt at the end i would recommend using unsalted butter in the receipe when having to use additional salt i will keep on had and use again you,226
12458,1057289,5,this is i just used 6 chicken breasts instead of the 3 lbs chicken pieces and it turned out i love getting new crockpot recipes,127
89493,424494,5,you don t miss out on too much taste by not having flour and everything else in them i really liked them i doubled the batch because i did not want to share my 3 pancakes with my daughter and all together is 8 size pancakes i think one batch would get you closer to 4 than 3 i subbed ground flaxseed meal for the wheat germ,323
56,2002628678,4,i had leftover buttermilk and a pie shell in the freezer so it was the perfect time to a pie i have been teaching my husband to cook since i had surgery a month ago and can t stand in the kitchen too long i talk him thru recipes and supervise while i sit and watch he has been doing a job and actually loves it he left it in the oven too long it over browned but it was i disagree with those who say it is too sweet i think it is perfect like it is is there such thing as too sweet i am going to reserve the last star for when we do it again and don t overcook it we think it is a light pie,590
78761,84361,4,this to follow was a hit with my family i used a cup of mushrooms and a cup of cooked sausage for toppings my youngest thought eggs and tomato sauce were a weird combination but that didn t stop her from eating it all up a keeper for sure,238
311202,1161678,3,i really like the sound of this but not sure what it would go with can anyone help me i m going to it anyway i amanda s onion jam and it is really and i don t like onion that much i ll give it 3 s and sort the rating after,222
82897,149180,5,i had extra strawberries from a pary and i did not want them to ruin i this as a glaze for to refridegerate and use for toppings over ice cream strawberry shortcake the cake was your 7 up pound cake amd pancakes it was and economical and,237
385433,2000824261,5,what a the meat filling is outstanding took them to a pot luck they were the first thing eaten even over the corned beef and cabbage i will use regular size biscuits next time grands were too much bread,202
31320,321163,5,my breadcrumbs also got clumpy but i rachael ray s version a few months ago with corn meal and it was not nearly as it got tough and the coating just didn t cut it but this what a snack probably not the healthiest thing to eat but it s rich and you don t need a lot it definitely satisfies that fried craving yum for posting,324
25690,2001630504,5,i m not really a pancake eater so i don t serve them often this is a game changer so tender amp moist i did add about 1 2 tsp of vanilla rum extract makes for a flavor too a keeper,180
222197,196038,4,this is a cool veggie dish for the hot summers in our location i think that i will add sliced onion to it for a little more flavor next time but still we liked it alot for this cool,181
25768,282079,5,i ve never been a fan of making potato salad but this one is a keeper first sure you don t overcook the potatoes this seems to be the problem i ve had in the past followed the and ingredients nearly exact except i used horseradish prepared mustard webers which gave this a kick i also added 6 slices of finely chopped cooked bacon i it again today and pre peeled and diced the potatoes it seemed to go more quickly this way because they cook and cooler faster we re really enjoying this and,490
190489,587909,1,i love hummus and all the ingredients in this but i think the orange was too overpowering perhaps using less zest or more acid like mixing in a little lemon juice would help,173
187477,625299,5,will use this for stir fry of every type from now on it s a perfect starting point that you can build on in so many ways for sharing,132
264172,2744976,1,i now know why there is no photo it doesn 039 t turn out one of the worst recipes i have tried,94
103269,2206637,5,so much for sharing i just threw it all together out of the starting gate and added 1 2 a jalapeno too so a ton sue lau,119
486117,135872,4,sounds like a for using up leftovers i just would probably do some sauteed onions instead of the mix just for health reasons for posting,136
28468,1108749,5,i loved this i used light cream chesse and healthy request soup i also subed chicken breast meat for the tuna since only two of the five of us like tuna i will reduce the onion by about half i found the onion flavor was a little over powering this was just so and i would recommend this to anyone who would that would take it you so much for posting it,352
159787,982889,5,this is a very and to follow and everyone loves it don t need to choose between the flan or the cake have both,110
45069,1806068,5,perfect chili loved it i did use more of the spice mixture than the called for so it was far from bland,103
56366,2960696,3,i this soup as specified except i left out the added salt since many of the ingredients are already salty onion soup mix soy sauce it was still very salty i also took other people 039 s advice and cooked the pasta on the side to add to each portion as needed and avoid sogginess i used some of the pasta water to add to the soup to it less salty lt br gt lt br gt on the plus side it is very and the flavour is once you cut the salt hearty and texture with the added liquid and pasta on the side i 039 d give it four stars,522
20061,26268,5,i love this it s the best tasting and easiest way to banana pudding ever yum,76
229767,380667,5,this was the first cake that i learned to when i was a young teenager many years ago before mixes i still have the and use it often i also have the for chocolate and banana lovelight cake,187
109716,2000380901,5,absolutely the fastest and easiest my daughter and myself loved it for sharing,78
22782,104876,5,this was so to prepare and it tasted wonderful my husband loved it too the flavors were i liked that it had some kick to it i m giving the to a friend because i told her how it was,180
481695,2449949,5,i this on the stove instead of on the grill and used penne instead of linguini because that is what i had on hand we loved it and i will it again i did take the clams out and discard the shells and cut the larger clams into smaller pieces just to it easier to eat,263
147444,1015482,5,cheesecake i was in peanut butter heaven for several minutes i used lower fat cream cheese and sour cream and it turned out perfect next time i might try adding more peanut butter flavor though i mine gluten free too,216
104767,376051,5,makes perfect fudge the consistency is the best,47
32216,497564,5,however my british friend that makes this adds a twist she puts a little horseradish in with the sprouts and gives the entire dish a little zip at first i couldn t imagine it but believe me it and your was you need to try it the suggestion to add an egg was a one worked well but just a little fyi for lynn in ri my daughter currently lives in england my own in laws are transplants from england born and raised and all of them tell me that this dish was always with brussel sprouts that is what the bubble is they have no idea where you got the idea that it was usually with cabbage but that was not ever the case unless the b sprouts at the grocers didn t look at the time they wanted to the dish but these days the frozen brussel sprouts work just as well as fresh,767
284370,943614,4,very and an interesting flavor i added a bag of frozen veg some raisins and extra curry powder i thought it was missing something flavor wise but my family liked it,164
78237,394617,5,this was i really enjoyed it the dough was hard to work with but that was to be expected it has a smell and a flavor i can t wait to have a piece in the morning with my coffee,175
39316,229753,5,i exactly as posted used an 8x8 glass pyrex dish and baked at 350 degrees for one hour perfect and a hit with my whole family my 4 year old grandson loved it i will again and again for posting,192
129926,2000909887,1,this was so boring i had to put a lot of sriracha on mine,57

18482,21730,4,i ve always enjoyed your scottish recipes miller and this one is yet another one of your idea thx,97
126480,2001892529,5,use non runny salsa mine was alittle watery prob will warm up the beans before layering maybe even add some cheese to them i like them with motzerella i skipped the guacamole cuz we don t care for it i added diced onions too flavor and pretty also,247
142524,1169062,5,very just like my mom used to i used fat free milk not that it a difference will again,86
360428,679706,5,followed exactly with leftover mashed potatoes this potatoe caserole is so you ll be making extra mashed potatoes just to this,126
61414,216476,5,i also used garlic powder instead of mustard and i think i ll use a little less salt next time but this was i also basted this every 15 minutes but you really don t have to my little brother and his friends at the dorm cleaned their plates very to will definetly do this again,276
191239,780249,4,super well worth your time if you re in the kitchen anyway throw these on your guests will enjoy them i cut into fun diagonal pieces which seemed a bit more festive next to the other christmas appetizers,203
89840,177085,5,this was so mashed potato heaven,32
89651,190886,4,but too sweet i will cut down on the sugar next time,52
13776,828499,5,this will be my go to holiday cranberry salad i took it to a thanksgiving party and had 4 people ask for the likeit,115
320408,945289,1,the pork chops and stuffing were dry and the chops were way overcooked and there really wasn t what i consider to be enough stuffing to put both under and on top of the 4 chops more like enough for 2 if you like stuffing i don t see any need to cook them before baking either it the chops tough and just another mess to clean up and another pan to wash imho i don t think we will these again as no one finished theirs sorry for the low stars but i have to be honest here for sharing anyway,489
49786,754772,5,the ingredients in this for a really flavored ham we will be having this one again we had with fresh peeled potatoes cooked in with 219319 and what a meal,154
54607,827921,5,this went very well with my buttered chicken i would add more coconut milk next time as this was more subtle but it was a pretty color and perfect texture very much for this and,177
15027,2017193,5,a real winner i listened to the reviewers and 1 2 the sauce and now i m sorry the whole batch if you don t use i m sure you can freeze and use next time and to cook best thing you probably have all of the ingredients needed in the cupboard already so much for a fabulous moist meatloaf beats mine hands down,307
64446,1542009,5,everybody loved this bread and so did i it turned out perfect try it you ll love it too,87
50467,540244,3,this isn t a bad but to thicker pancakes just add more flour i a few on an old pancake skillet and found they were way to thin but with another 1 2 1 c flour the next ones came out like big fluffy pancakes,205
14057,23646,5,fabulous the hit of the party to can probably use other veges besides zucchini such as spinach chopped broccoli,111
52680,594620,5,fabulous i a couple changes as follows 1 i used florida s crystals organic cane sugar because i was planning to give this to my 27 month old and 12 month old for our 4th of july dessert i only give them organic cane sugar as it doesn t promote tooth decay 2 i used butter instead of margarine in both the brownies and the glaze 3 i used a 9 square pan and cooked them at 350 for 20 minutes that s when the toothpick came out clean 4 i did not add nuts unti the very end when putting together my brownie a la mode desserts because i gave this to my 12 month old who is too young for nuts 5 for the glaze i actually it into more of a real glaze than a frosting after adding 2 tbsp of boiling water it was still very very thick so i added 1 3 to 1 2 cup of heavy whipping cream this it a runny glaze i added half to the top of the brownies while in the pan it absorbed into them and them totally i used the other half to pour on top of the final creation the way i served these was to cut off a brownie and heat it up in the microwave i then added a small scoop of vanilla ice cream i topped that with a dollop of the revised glaze i then i topped that off with a few chopped walnuts and a dollop of fresh whipped cream fabulous dessert we all went crazy for it for such a quick brownie,1283
268510,443407,4,i used lime juice instead of the vinegar chicken thighs and added a cup of sliced shitake mushrooms it was enjoyed by all,121
106643,1316807,5,just up a batch for dinner liked it very much but did not chop the garlic fine enough maybe next time i ll use a little garlic powder to taste,142
392853,1803724327,5,i this once and it was a hit but somehow i lost this i 039 ve tried several other lemon chicken orzo soup from other network sites but most of them turned out bitter glad i find this again i found out the other sites called for way too much lemon its like 4 times the lemon here and because of that no one liked my soup lt br gt today i this again my kids love it so much that they are asking to have it for school lunch tomorrow for sharing such,446
38298,1800399908,5,absolutely divine i use half mild italian sausage,49
310131,1052065,5,this is one of my pick a chef 2009 recipes that i chose the feta really played a major part in this by balancing out the flavors with the sauted veggies my 7 yr old daughter loved this so that means i will be making this again soon i used more olive oil than the called for and of course more feta also i used regular cream of chicken not fat free,347
439643,945395,5,unbelievably if i gain an eighth of a pound i don t care it s fantabulous and i ll it again and again laurenpie for pac spring 2011,131

104766,309422,5,i this for the basketball game saturday afternoon it was supposed to be a snack but my husband and i ended up eating the whole pie pan full for lunch i did a few changes i added some chopped white onion on top of the cream cheese used hot spicy chili added some sliced jalepenos and sprinkled a little bit of cilantro on top my husband who doesn t like cream cheese really liked this i tried this dip at a party with the fritos scoops before but really like the tortilla chips much better,488
242388,576767,5,we loved these i added a little sugar to the sauce we like sweet sauces the monterey jack cheese is really in this next time i d like to try already roasted chicken from the market in these so and tasting you,208
7716,609913,5,very crawfish pies are just divine,34
93017,449929,3,this is and surprising that it is for you one of my husband s favorites i usually use more apples,97
69063,1145840,5,yum i ve been trying to find some friendly recipes for a non vegetable lover and this definitely fits the bill i used panko with a little bit of parmesan seasoned breadcrumbs i didn t really measure the ingredients but i probably used the higher amount of garlic powder and i also added some cayenne next time i might increase the amount of cayenne and i want to figure out a way to more evenly coat the zucchini but i will definitely these again,446
83719,512461,5,this was i had pineapple balsamic vinegar that went well with the salmon,72
411501,2248756,5,i have been making these for some time now and they are and guilt free i add a tbs of ground flax to the cottage cheese for additional fiber,140
312380,915728,5,this is my favorite one ever i this all the time because its so and it tastes so the bacon gives it a flavor but bacon gives anything a flavor this is,150
77316,347536,5,yum yum yum i followed the directions exactly and was rewarded at the end with fabulous flavorful soup,102
208952,573544,3,not bad very just kind of bland for us,38
178262,28170,1,followed the directions exactly and used all ingredients listed didn t care for this at all bland expensive to and time consuming i won t be making this again sorry but i found it tasteless and not worth the effort or expense,225
283461,1168372,4,this is true comfort it s best i agree that there are some bones in the gravy but to find i don t have kids i do recommend that you spray the crock pot w pam before putting the chicken in the pot the clean up was difficult i ll definitely this again for a,255
357280,20395,5,this has a really flavor i bumped up the amount of beef dh wouldn t know what do with all those veggies but otherwise i wouldn t change a thing he wants me to try it with pork next time,185
23766,82994,5,i this as posted and it was outstanding sandwich karen i may just for fun get on it with a little hot sauce next time just to see what happens fantastic as is tho,162
13596,129856,5,excellent soup we were hankering for french onion soup and this was wonderful even my boys aged 3 4 loved it instead of the crock i simmered on stove top for about 2 hours also added 1 tsp of sugar as i didn t use all sweet onions we melted swiss and jarlsberg cheese on top and used crusty french bread can t wait to it again yum,330
100775,983953,5,this for 20 people for a break fast tonight big hit,51
29329,2001420574,3,who has the time to put every single part of a salad inside a tiny pieco o pasta,80
332582,1448193,5,i served this cake to my brother last night and he was ooh and aahing then his wife told him that it was pumpkin and i had no idea that that he actually didn t like pumpkin before eating this cake needless to say i gave his wife a copy of the to take home,255
222436,482812,5,this is sooooo i love the addition of cinnamon my sister is notorious for being grumpy when she wakes up and when we had to get up super early for a family trip i this and it perked her right up,194
6504,45833,5,i have these several times they are i ve had many people ask for the the cookies need a while several days or so in a tightly sealed container to mellow as they will be very crisp to start or if you bake right away they will be chewy on cooling as if they d been mellowed the result either way is a tender cookie with what looks like white icing on top for posting,364
19918,79413,5,this is really everyone in my family really loves it and often encourages seconds once the tummys still have the space i didn t have onion powder so i chopped onions instead i also used canned corn instead of frozen corn and added a little garlic to it it s excellent it s also wonderful if you add chicken breast with the pasta even bacon by itself taste with it i definitely recomment it it s the bomb,403
434848,2000532454,5,excellent this was a huge hit in our house only thing was the large eggplants needed more than 20 minutes to get soft,117
50191,31635,5,simply meal a bit messy to but so worth the effort comfort perfect winter meal,78
500210,16459,5,this was to use the roast was really really i gravy from the pan drippings and i 039 m pretty sure my life has changed for the better for having eaten that gravy i did alter the cooking tim to two hours since i had a smaller roast than the calls for i will definitely this again and again,288
144691,359707,4,this is a wonderful soup i even left out the carrots celery ribs rosemary and 2 and 1 2 cups of chicken broth didn t have enough ingredients at home i actually substituted 1 cup of water for 1 cup of chicken broth overall it came out so much for the,249
25421,28846,5,what a creamy milk chocolate pie almost like a mousse this was not the quickest pie to but well worth the wait next time i think i ll use a little more whipping cream for my topping as i found i could have used more to evenly top the chocolate filling the grated chocolate bar on top of the whipped cream makes for quite a presentation i could also see making the pie with a chocolate cookie crumb crust rather than a baked pie crust note that this uses a 1 55 oz hershey chocolate bar standard size which can be purchased in a package of six candy bars in the us,563
377272,2057611,5,you you you i just this tonight and it was so very i gave up meat dairy 3 months ago and have been very happy but i used to looove me some mac cheese this really hit the spot i m pretty sure i ll keep some of this in my fridge on a regular basis oh and i registered on this website just to say for your,302
140935,306657,5,i this soup for a friend she s not fond of cilantro so i cut down on that and added more parsley also threw in an extra cup of chick peas so as not to waste them and used fresh ginger rather than ground ginger my grocery store didn t have a fennel bulb so i used an anise bulb i really liked the flavour and would definitely this again i also served it with corn bread it was a big hit,385
79944,588049,5,i just ate this for dinner and i must say i was very pleased i used chicken tenders and applied dollops of cream cheese along the tops and then wrapped the bacon around it i don t know if the butter was really necessary because the bacon provided plenty of grease we won t have enough left to freeze my husband gobbled all of it up except for one piece it s very rich and tastes like it s a lot more complicated to you for sharing such a lovely,444
153766,638072,5,thats a dip what a idea too i love pepperoncini s almost as much as my husband,78
212605,245017,4,i m glad i tried this it wasn t bad but it was really either i liked that it was different and it covered the taste of the cauliflower update i ve this a few times now and it s really grown on me i did cup down the mayo mustard to just 1 8 cup each and that a big difference for me,281
120426,269293,5,i these burgers and was shocked by how they were used chetter cheese but went by the rest of the way suggest finely chopping the beans instead of mashing them for a little more texture and adding some bread crumbs or flour so the patties won t be quite as sticky also use fresh jalapenos,287
101954,2084063,5,pecan pie is my husband 039 s very favorite pie when thanksgiving rolled around this year i couldn 039 t find my box so turned to the computer recipes hoping for something that was equal to the pecan pies i have baked for 43 years for him i not only found a like it but found a new twist in the boiling of sugars ahead of time i put in more pecans and mix them in with the filling as i always have the results even thicker and more gooey than ever my husband flipped amp even had 2 pieces two days later and i 039 m making another needless to say this is it from now on p crocker,579
2886,2001707927,5,new house so i didn t have vanilla but still tasted i used 3 large over ripe bananas and added cinnamon and allspice to give it a more spiced taste was will continue to use this,177
90227,226462,5,i used the struesal topping on 255789 for a extra flavoring can t wait to muffins and use the nut and sugar cinnamon topping as well gerry for posting this,155

22688,38937,5,excellent chicken marinade sprinkled lemon pepper seasoning on the chicken as i cooked it,89
133926,196296,5,for this it s so worth it to your own curry paste it tastes soooo much fresher than the store bought this does come together in 10 minutes if that the flavors all work really well together and it was and spicy without being blowing my head off hot i didn t have kaffir lime rind so just used regular lime i this for a thai curry i last night and i have enough for 3 more curries or so well you again this is wonderful and i ll it again,435
68386,1141659,5,this is outstanding the only thing i changed was i eliminated the oregano added diced green chilis doubled the cumin and chili powder and used a shredded rotissorie chicken it tastes better than a restuarant soup,212
113053,578353,5,i fell in love with this and have it several times like a rich cheesecake but lighter in texture the crust is too wonderful next time i may swap out the cherry and use strawberry pie filling,190
306133,486680,4,lovely flavour i liked the wee kick from the cayenne it tonight for my husband and one of our friends and they gave it 4 stars and my husband is very fussy for a lainey,168

323513,930470,1,was too pepper y to eat next time i would half the pepper and double the honey i scraped off the sauce and the chicken was still too spicy to eat and i love spicy,162
141917,435388,4,i couldn t find kalamata olives at the grocery store so i just used high quality black olives this was really though i did add some salt toward the end,151
59745,206861,2,i had expected it to be much more exciting and,46
75873,227226,5,very my son was scared they were going to taste like the soup but they didn t at all i didn t have dry ranch mix so i just cut back on the milk and added regular ranch dressing yum so much nurse di,197

343698,41779753,5,my son requested schwarzw auml lder kirschtorte for his birthday because we heard about it in our german lessons i balked at the idea of paying 30 for a cake from the local german restaurant and decided to try making it myself so i googled and found this i 039 m so glad i did what a cake i followed the advice of others and didn 039 t put 1 2 cup of kirsch on the cakes i only used about a tablespoon per layer and brushed it on with a pastry brush i also used canned tart cherries because fresh ones are nowhere to be found in january they didn 039 t look so but they did the job i also used a little bit more confectioners sugar in the filling because i thought it needed to be stiffer so that it wouldn 039 t squish out from between the layers by the way the coffee in the filling was fabulous i will definitely this cake again lt br gt lt br gt bekah danke f uuml r das rezept es ist sehr lecker und gar nicht so schwer,924
122197,2112736,5,the recipes left out one critical preparation step for this dish you must let it set for at least a few hours better overnight before you bake it so pour the egg mixture over the bread cream cheese fruit cover refrigerate then bake covered at 350 for 30 minutes remove the cover and bake for an additional 30 minutes i used frozen strawberries so i had to bake an additional 10 minutes to accommodate the extra liquid also a little hit of maple syrup all the difference if you want some sweetness i thought this was,515
66990,539990,5,wow i loved this dish i used a bit less olive oil because i ran out but it didn t seem to a difference however this is a masterpiece and i would not omit or substitute a single ingredient even if y all think you don t like napa cabbage or carrots in a taco give it a shot it s crazy how this is you kristin update i it a second time with the correct amount of olive oil and it was too much next time i will cut the amount by half and i think that will be perfect,462
166157,254909,5,i doubled the but only used a 15 oz can of pumpkin i used all whole wheat flour except for 2 3 c regular white flour and only put in 2 3 c sugar hmm okay i also left out the nuts and compensated by upping the amount of chocolate chips fantastic results will most definitely be making it again,292
371297,442706,5,i thought i had the perfect brownie until i tried this one i do not like cake like brownies but soft and rich brownies wow this can t be beat the only thing i did different was omitted one cup of chocolate chips when they are added into batter and added 1 cut chopped walnuts i brought them to the office and beforef 10 a m they were gone everyone will think you got them at an expensive bakery,394
176267,517198,5,my dh and i loved this we halved the and it was but somewhat bland for our taste so we added a couple teaspoons of cajun seasoning and it turned out wonderful next time we will nix the peas,189
371607,2001788949,5,the best dessert ever so well liked by all,42
31546,15381,5,i this as shown for a party we were attending and it was gone at the end of the night everyone loved it,103
182195,592646,5,i had to write a review since i ve this twice now and my husband absolutely loves this dish i actually found this by the same name on another site many reviews were submitted and was a smash hit i learned from the reviews that 2 lbs of meat is simply too much for just 8 peppers so i prepare this with just 1 lb of meat and i use mild italian chicken sausage i also cook the sausage first and try to get a few caramelized bits in there as i cook the sausage i use a potato masher to try and declump the sausage after it has cooked i dump the sausage onto a plate covered with paper towel to soak up the olive oil and any fat before i prepare the sausage mixture because i use only 1 lb of sausage i cut the ingredients for the sausage mixture in half except for the egg speaking of the egg this doesn t state where when to use the egg but it s to act as the glue for the sausage mixture with 1 lb of meat i was able to 7 stuffed peppers super stuffed and of size with enough left over just to plug up just at the opening 3 peppers that i stuffed only with fresh mozzarella cheese i ve used both anaheim and cubanelle peppers the first time i this i boiled the peppers as instructed and last night i didn t near the end of the baking time i add mozzarella on top and take the dish out after it has melted i put crushed red peppers on the table for those who would like to add a bit more heat to their dish you ll find that this is very similar it extremely similar to 92892 stuffed banana peppers on this site,1508
400884,1800093896,5,my favorite filipino dish by far,32
38065,30209,4,this was really to put together and very i used mrs cubbison s stuffing with cranberries the sweet tart cranberries were a addition i would also add a few veggies next time onions carrots and or green peppers,208
94475,69927,5,wow i ve been drooling over this photo for a while and i just had to try it i used 9186 for the brownies fresh strawberries best choice french vanilla pudding and best choice non dairy whipped topping i also didn t have a clear bowl so i layered this into individual bowls one of each other layers except the choc shell i didn t once over the strawberries and once over the pudding whipped cream mix this was so i love the burst of tartness from the strawberries the texture of the pudding and whipped topping went very well with fruit and crumbled brownie the shell hadn t set up hard but was just firm the whole thing was very much a delight i a whole which was likely a mistake my waistline will grow to regret but dh liked it enough that this may not be too much of a problem you for the keeper,798
46501,262200,5,this was and i used half whole wheat flour with about 1 1 2 tsp of gluten i will definitely return to this many times makes toast,129
272698,1271905,5,i wasn t sure this would be very but i needed something fast and because i was feeling lazy it was o you,104
136589,291306,5,i have to agree with the name of this it is the best i used pecans instead of walnuts personal preference and it was very moist and sweet,137
137331,154853,3,this was okay i it exactly as per the but did not peel the red potatoes if i it again i would add a lot more lemon garlic and cheese just personal taste,152
217710,238496,5,mr sauce occasionally my dh will christen certain recipes as the family default congratulations you have the cut this is a goo barbecue sauce we the sauce and let it settle over night last night we used it on some pork ribs and we were delighted with outcome i followed your instructions to the letter and i do agree with you that the times should be adhered to for another one t3,380
51267,273895,4,wonderful for the calorie conscious tastes and looks i skipped the pasta and served it over raw baby spinach for a true ww dinner mmmm,134
196177,756573,5,this was a steak i was a little skeptical at first while i was prepairing it but after i was finished and paired the steak and the butter i decided this will be a repeat for an,176
98127,849642,5,i m pregnant so it s even more unsafe for me to eat raw cookie dough i was so glad to have found this it cured my craving it s definately worth trying,150
27399,228744,5,excellent tasting cake my wife even like it and that s hard to do to save time i have started using a can of dulce de leche instead of making it myself and have had the same results,181
295813,1601627,5,i thought these were i didn t think they even tasted healthy i used splenda for the sugar and it worked i think the cinnamon and nutmeg really it the only thing i didn t like was the way mine looked because i wasn t sure how big to them on the pan they didn t really expand when baked like i thought and so they came out small and not as flat as they should be so next time i ll just place them out better they still tasted lol,427
192639,1047326,5,a and tastes i would know it s my moms,38
74629,254909,5,exactly what i was expecting it to be my husband described it as earthy and my 18 mo old who hasn t had much of an appetite lately due to teething ate an entire bowl the one minute tweak i was grating two large garlic cloves instead of the powder i also omitted the cheese and we all thought it was wonderful,308
120401,93165,5,i also added some finely chopped jalapenos and some crumbled feta cheese to the mixture which went down really well can t find the cheese you mentioned in the uk but monterey jack for the topping did the job again,213
45187,153405,5,i loved this super and taste i ended up having to substitute the sour cream w 3 t milk and 1 4 c light mayo i also used paprika and added some lawry s seasoned salt instead of chili powder i ended up using close to 2 cups of corn flakes as suggested i sprayed w icbinb spray instead of margine i will definately again,317
358360,1219023,4,this was really and very to really handy in a pinch i added cumin and fennel seed to the beef and it really this for me and my family you,137
76892,138861,4,very i this for my dh s birthday and even my non alcohol drinking in laws ans kids enjoyed the flavour i did however find that the cheesecake itself was a bit soft runny i don t know why because i cooked it for nearly 1 hour oh well it was still,245
224031,561580,4,these this afternoon for girls night and they were a huge hit i cheated a touch and like nonnie4two i added toffee bits in the batter as well the girls all loved them the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that they were a tad wet for my taste i tend to like a cakier brownie,280
356040,2000310796,5,at first i hesitated to try it but i came around and it 039 s soon,66
133448,981918,3,this is much better to me then the typically prepared ramen noodles to me they are just too salty even when i use less of the flavor packlet i used the chicken variety to this and it was although very rich and i think i will decrease the flavor pavket amount next time it is a little bland to just be a meal on it s own and i think it would be much better if mixed with some cooked chicken and veggies for the though,416
19502,15892,4,and i love picatta i m going to this sauce for five nights in a row served over different meats so i can practice the sauce and find its perfect mate salmon steak with braised kale was surprisingly,197
281489,32143,4,i really liked this i used minute rice according to box directions left out the peas and coriander never had before may try next time and used less garlic and cayenne also added salt and pepper i tried warm and cold both ways you,229
126955,1248794,5,i could just eat this and eat this there is not stopping me now what a refreshing salad with lots of fiber and nutrition what a mix of flavors we have here,155
215873,975756,5,perfect don t change a thing this will be my default lamb curry from now on i wonder if spinach would be ok in it to a saag,123
260781,2001686020,2,i these exactly as the instructed and i was a bit disappointed the muffins taste pretty bland and are somewhat dry my husband said they d be ok with coffee probably if i them again i ll add a few more ingredients maybe more pumpkin pie spices or apple sauce something to give them more flavor and moisture,305
28491,67491,5,this cake is soooo it for my son s b day party and everyone loved it i pretty much followed the except that i used 5 eggs and 2 cups sugar in the cake mix i also only used about 5 cups powdered sugar for the frosting so as not to overwhelm the cream cheese flavor,263
176286,195212,5,this is such a way to prepare brats for a barbecue i this the day before i was serving them then the day of we threw them on the grill and because they were pre cooked we only had to browned them up a little reheated the sauerkraut on the stove top served the brats with german curry sauce for wurst 37911 and pleased a crowd of people this is a keeper,352
456823,2001642363,5,it s spectacular for thanksgiving and christmas,47
135350,2001215919,5,with all due respect to my grandma rest her soul this might be the best mac and cheese i have ever had definitely the best i have ever i doubled the and used 3 cups of sharp cheddar and 1 cup of mozzarella because i didn t have enough cheddar it was exaclty the right amount for a 13x9 pan it was sort of a lot of effort but it was worth it one thing i noticed is that the sauce got a little thick so i had to add a little milk when i added the cheese it started the become a giant ball of cheese maybe my measurements were off a little but i suspect some of the 10 minute simmer time is a little long,601
31750,956276,5,this is and the batter seemed way too thin at first but they turned out i just have to master the art of how much batter to put in my waffle iron keep oozing out the sides elaine,178
51936,313369,5,i thought these were does the last reviewer know that what they described is exactly what biscotti is lol sorry but the review cracked me up biscotti are supposed to be very hard and dry they are for dipping in coffee or hot chocolate i suggest you try that you might have an entirely different review after,307
34688,490200,5,this was i added an extra half tsp of oregano and basil went with red bell instead of green because of family preference and ended up slicing about 4 cloves of garlic over the top of it all while it cooked just because we are insane about garlic we also used cheddar cheese instead savory hearty for a meal,306
112683,159179,5,my gosh these cookies are my 8 year old son loves these these are fantastic you for sharing the,95
242317,128945,5,greg this is perfect can i add one small trick i learned from my abuelita crush the garlic and the salt together until you have a puree for posting this t j,156
52500,750362,4,and light i did add jalapeno peppers and red pepper flakes,58
62907,168922,5,this is an excellent basic to either be for quick fixes or extravagant for parties by adding your own signature ingredients to the core ones very,145
108059,110682,5,i used this cake as a base for strawberry shortcake it was incredibly moist and fluffy this will be my go to for yellow cake now i didn t have buttermilk on hand so i used regular 2 milk scalding it slightly it worked perfectly zusie q,235
189156,980899,5,both versions regular cream cheese and the cheesecake filling everyone who tasted them said both were but most prefered the regular cream cheese they freeze well too,165
231036,382123,4,this is a delightful loaded with wonderful goodies when i have a banana that is becoming too ripe i throw it in a plastic bag in the freezer when i ve collected enough i ll a banana bread because i had so many i doubled the and baked four mini loaves darling i toasted the coconut and walnuts first to bring out their flavors after cooling i wrapped the loaves in plastic wrap and put the in vacuum sealed bags to freeze removing one at a time keeps them fresh i enjoy this bread lightly toasted with a cup of coffee or tea,523
23404,385189,5,this is very and very my husband asked for black bean soup and i wanted something and quick this is not only quick and it is i it exactly as the directions indicate and was very pleasantly surprised at how it was for posting it on the web,238
26110,1356293,5,excellent i didn t follow instructions to a t and left out the extra flour therefore leaving the dough a little sticky i liked it this way because i just spooned it in the pan and didn t have to mess with rolling and cutting they turned out,240
416703,111296,5,what a quick and for applesauce i used macouns since that is what i had on hand and it was i did not add any sugar and the natural sweetness of the apples was enough i this for best of 2011 cookbook game for a that i will definitely be making again,248
28341,2798981,5,will this again everyone enjoyed it saved energy by simmering on top of the stove at a low simmer for 3 hours,109
56076,162888,5,i this with plain yogurt and it worked really well,50
58823,416292,5,excellent inexpensive meal i think maybe next time i will serve over rice i let everything simmer in some chicken broth for added flavor also helped to soup it up a bit i didn t saute in oil since kielbasa has enough of it s own oils,233
217948,870390,4,i used chicken thighs wth the bone for this worked except i reccommend de skinning first and letting the spices sink directly into the meat,139
27101,2002516120,4,a family favourite but you need to use campbell s soup the others just don t have as a flavour i can even use just one can of soup and half milk half water and it s still,170
222047,113894,4,for pac spring 07 anything with pb and chocolate is to go in this house the was to i mixed everything by hand and that was fine i bought the exact ingredients called for so i could this the way it was intended the only thing i added some peanut butter chips to the top for garnish btw 1 tb of skim milk plus 1 tsp of skim milk is the same thing as 4 tsps or 20ml that may be helpful to someone i used an 8x8 pan and though the batter was very shallow in the pan they rose to about 1 2 inch we liked the flavor a lot the pb was not overwhelming i m not a huge fan like the rest of the crew so this is a must if i m going to like it too the texture of these are a little bit chewy and a drier texture like a cookie or tea cake this is definately a lower fat than most brownie recipes and i recommend it if you are looking for that kind of thing for sharing your christine,869
242859,1119069,4,these are just like a chocolate cupcake you cannot tell there is any zucchini in them at all i didn t have the chocolate chips but it turned out very anyway will definitely it again for the,189
291684,937970,5,very unusual taste but well worth it once you mix it it doesn t last but that s not a problem since it s impossible to put this down,132
125903,225096,5,this is for the meatloaf only since i didn t the sauce this was a really tasting meatloaf i used a finely shredded colby jack cheese the only thing i did differently was add and egg and use only 1 t of worcestershire sauce because that seemed like plenty to me this turned out very moist and tender next time may use red bell pepper and try the sauce a keeper for posting,371
29129,705405,5,this was a real keeper i added mushrooms instead of green peppers my hubby hates them and omitted the tabasco because my kids are really sensitive to anything spicy i also used 2 cups of chicken broth and a quarter cup of water this was plenty the rice was perfect the flavors are nothing too over powering blends very nicely perfect compliment to a lemon pepper turkey breast and steamed green beans,400
195729,317004,5,i cut back the butter a bit omitted the sour cream because i didn t have any and used a bit more milk salt and pepper soooo who needs gravy went well with a southwestern meatloaf and caramelized roasted balsamic onions for posting will definitely again these would be with something off the grill because of the matched smoky flavor,332
60598,689540,5,worth five stars with the following adjustments use one jar of nutella instead of chocolate sure you use unsalted butter use shallots instead of onion up the garlic to 3 bulbs add the bitters to the evoo and finally do not apply the patch to the upper arm it works much better when applied to the left cheek and i don t mean the one you apply blush to,351
16887,68656,5,i agree this is the only onion ring i have used where the coating stays on the rings they were,94
94164,512461,5,whole family loved this we all thought it was better than any we have had before,80
218376,2049165,5,half the and used cheddar cheese because that s all i had and added 1 8 tsp of ground mustard,93
57060,123955,5,you so much for posting an yet i cut your in half for five servings and it came out wonderful following the suggestions from previous comments i added vanilla cinammon and nutmeg also the called for a bit too much sugar for my taste so i reduced it i will definitely be making this again yum,291
235903,838461,5,this was a dish once you are finished preparing the veggies it goes very fast i it with some more mushrooms and asparagus and reduced the amount of whole wheat noodles my husband enjoyed it and i had some leftovers for lunch today i also skipped the additional salt and used low sodium soy sauce it tasted,305
10889,101539,5,this was very and me look like the hostess with the mostess there were no leftovers i did cut down on the sugar and used those pre shortcakes from the store and only had vanilla flavoring next time i will use the almond but it really did turn out well so much for posting,271
16957,528121,5,fantastic this is such an i used imitation crabmeat chopped up fat free mayo and fat free cream cheese even with those changes it was still,139
497021,2752051,5,i love this so to and flavor my family and friends loves this a must,68
103688,179003,5,this was really went very well with curd rice i quartered the brinjals used 1 1 2 tbsp of sambhar masala and 1 tbsp of amchur and used corn oil i did sprinkle a little water to the eggplant to help in the cooking process as char said naming it subzi would be a better thing to do as it is a dry dish i never knew there was such a method to cook eggplants and this is guaranteed to eggplants one of my favorite veggies,417
112814,131349,4,i loved this a bit fatty so sure you drain the meat after cooking before you add the mashed tomatoes i had twice baked potatoes with this what a taste together,159
124324,372295,5,i a double batch of these for a party that i had and they were all gone they are a bit time consuming to but well worth it for such a,133
36666,565828,5,i think this is one of the best dips i have ever tasted my niece this for july 4th and it was gone in a flash to which is what my niece needs because she is new to cooking i think the blend is just right and i would not change a thing way to go and you for posting such a fantastic dip,285
345545,1189556,5,i this to put in the freezer because i have so much left over ham i did taste it before i put it in the freezer it was delecious the only thing i did different is add some broccoli,180
78772,383795,5,i did have a few problems with the though i found that i had to boil the syrup for 20 minutes and it was still a little thin and i had to bake the cake for almost an hour this an enourmous cake way too much for our family of four considering the fact that it is so rich and a little piece goes a long way i will definately half it next time but it was worth five stars despite all that and i loved the rosewater in it,417
410364,2069962,4,fantastic sandwiches i these for my husband and his friends they loved them it was the perfect early 11am lunch with some fresh fruit and a cold glass of milk he was in heaven he said he would rather eat my cooking anytime instead of having lunch at local denver restaurants i ll take that as best as i can and keep making these for him,336
52094,69382,5,these were i used some tropical mix dried fruits as well as cranberries and used a mix of nuts instead of the peanuts i also added a touch of allspice and toasted the nuts along with the cereal and raisins,205
88223,282965,5,excellent instead of making individual dishes i one casserole dish it was i added a little bit more kaluha,106
151035,800324,5,i added a can of diced tomato too and a little bit of extra crushed red pepper and it was perfect this is the way gumbo should taste,132
126113,153253,4,my husband and i both liked this dish a lot the only thing that would it a 5 star instead of 4 was that it was a bit too sweet for our taste and we even left out the canned pineapple which is usually sweetened next time i will cut the amount of honey in 1 2 and maybe put less sugar and add something spicy in but overall it was and we served it with rice for a main dish,371
43516,667317,5,i have used this for years all the people that i served with in singles church group loved it it was one of the things i was always asked to,140
98940,1248818,5,excellent ribs right here if you haven t tried them you should,62
302913,1922187,5,cute idea you can really do this with almost anything i may try it with smokes salmon and add capers,100
59197,155244,5,this was really and creamy despite being dairy free a comfort meal i added some extra rice with the veggies to the soup heartier since it was the main course for a keeper evelyn,177
75913,135615,5,what a fatntastic peaceul solutions this is the first time i attemptedf to chinese fried rice and after looking at a variety of ones available i picked yours because of the detailed info on cooking it instead of saying cooked chicken in the list of ingredients you ve actually mentioned how i changes to the recipes well firstly i didn t have 4 hrs marination time nor white pepper so i marinated the chicken in somesoy sauce regular mind you throughout the half teaspoon chinese salt and a about half regular sauce i let it sit for 15 20 mins first time around as i chopped veggies and the second time this was so i it again the very next day and dh and i gobbled it in one sitting i had time to let it sit for 1 2 to 1 hr i then fried it in oil and about a teaspoon garlic paste you get these ready too the paste also when the rice was done i sprinkled about 1 2 teaspoon chinese salt again i also did not have peanut or olive oil and used regular oil and minus the carrots since none were at hand but peas were enough otherwise i followed the directions as closely as i could i did sort of pour the soy sauce straight of the bottle guestimating color and tasting till i was happy with the flavor of the rice wonderful,1220
132511,773748,5,so soft and chewy the sour cream was an interesting ingredient that i think makes these cookies different from all the rest i even used these cookies to sandwich melted marshmallow and chocolate to unique and incredibly smores,226
29886,44135,5,agreed this is absolutely a few tips from my point of view though 1 sure you do not over fry the seasonings 2 it is much nicer all round if you strain the resultant kardhi to remove the whole seasonings whice get in the way leaving you with a smooth tangy concoction 3 my punjabi roots call for the addition of some potato pakoras to add some more sustenance,358
102617,116977,5,like everyone said this tastes just like kfc or even applebee s coleslaw i was lazy and didn t feel like shredding the carrot and cabbage so i bought one of those coleslaw mix bags in the produce section i didn t take into account that the purple cabbage they toss in that mix would bleed purple and turn the whole dish purple still tasted perfect just a funky color keeper,373
235127,449702,5,i took these to a potluck tdf everyone thinks i am brilliant which is really cool these were so to prepare and so for posting,125
153539,101083,5,these were wonderful i used grande marnier instead of the vanilla for a adult treat i served these at an adult game night i always have lots of snacks and hors d oeuvres sitting around to nosh on but these were the first to go for a wonderful new idea for strawberries,268
10201,21424,5,i this all the time girl s night holiday snack table parties it s always requested it s so too my husband likes when i use just plain smashed avocados spiked with hot salsa and lemon juice for the 2nd layer i find that everyone loves the flavor of the taco seasoning mix with the mayo and sour cream i usually get asked about the unique flavor,343
51997,410092,5,wow these muffins are i did add a little vanilla to the batter and that was really also if this helps anyone i was able to get 12 stanard muffins and 12 mini muffins out of a double batch and i only needed a single batch of the crumb topping they turned out beautifully be sure to cut back the baking time on the minis this will be my only blueberry muffin from now on,368
16371,764128,5,i used the concept of buttering the tortillas and baking the chimis but i chose to a filling with shredded chicken and refried beans topped with sour cream guacamole and salsa these were and,190
108068,534554,5,this was very mac and cheese you have to like velveeta though i cut the sauce in half and used the same amount of noodles and while i could have used maybe 3 4 of a cup more milk when making the sauce it will look on the thin side and you want it thinner because it will be absorbed when baking it was just about perfect it just shy smaller than 13x9 pan i think it was 10x8 or something i would recommend mixing the sauce with the pasta well before pouring into the baking pan i personally didn t like the dry noodles on the bottom i like my sauce thoroughly mixed throughout also leave your pasta on the underdone side when boiling so that it will be al dente after baking since i had a smaller pan i also baked for less time for posting kmdipaolo,749
179316,452045,5,this is excellent we found that an even simpler method was to squeeze lemons then measure the juice use exactly the same volume each of water and sugar as there was of lemon juice and use sharon123 s method this way the number of lemons you have and how juicy they are is the controlling factor and it does beautiful lemonade,325
217245,470799,4,my whole family love the meal the kids hubby gobbled it right up it was to we are not huge fish fans but we do like tilapia this is worth a try,143
25534,666128,5,wow this was truly wonderful my husband loves catfish i only sorta like it but after i had this i ve it for anybody who will come over to the house it was you for such a,169
10966,1206115,5,these were the easiest cookies i ever keep posting recipes iris hartzell quick and with worth more than the effort,114
25441,131698,5,this was the first meal i for my husband a couple of years ago when we first started dating i think that was the night he decided i was the one this dish is alot of work but very well worth it,192
29939,169796,5,this was for sharing dh loved it,32
109448,374506,5,this is the first pot roast i have ever and it was i didn t change anything in the i cooked it on low for 7 hours the meat was tender and the veggies were soft firm perfect even my pickey boyfriend like it this is a keeper,222
347208,2000895221,5,quick and tastes the is as is but also lends itself well to modification see some of the other reviews for examples keeping this one on file for later,150
93667,146731,3,i used frozen corn for this it was way too sweet and as the other reviewer said some flour is needed for thickening it was sloshy sort of like creamed corn for dessert i don t mean to be rude but we were very disappointed,221
153540,517709,5,my guests loved this and i did too i did not have quite so much hot sauce since i didn t look at the closely however it turned out with approx 1 3 less hot sauce,161
12458,109811,5,i love this it is so creamy and i have even it using all low fat ingredients and it still came out i usually throw a whole chicken in the crock and then before i add the soup cheese etc i take out all the bones and skin and chop it up into bite size pieces just be careful not to burn your fingers,297
360032,1433377,5,very cookies my first tray came out a little too done on the bottom but that s because of issues with my oven the next tray was perfect,135
37374,2002791066,1,say it again for the people in the back pronto pups are entirely different than corn dogs this is a corn dog fix it,115
22671,1600909,5,okay this cake is phenomenal rave reviews from everyone for dh bday and it was enjoyed by him and everyone else someone even said this was the best chocolate cake he s ever had i will be making this again definately worth the effort that goes into it,250
64246,257730,5,love this i use tj s sun dried tomato pesto instead of reg pesto and sun dried tomatoes and i bite sized patties i serve this in a big bowl as part of my salad themed picnic every summer,186
106614,223216,4,this comes out every time i it every year for the holidays and i always get rave reviews,88
47261,82099,5,dh and i loved it my 16yr son sas iffy on it as for some reason my cottage cheese did not blend in either i used small curd so i think next time i will whip my cottage cheese first then blend in the other ingredients,216
138940,657549,5,omg this is the best pie crust i have ever tasted it was also very to i substituted a bob s red mill all purpose gf baking flour for the rice flower i a pumpkin pie with mine and it was so i will never a different kind of pie crust,231
106987,307592,5,this is so and so and it s true you wouldn t know it was tofu my husband haaaaaaates tofu and when i told him i was making it he whined and whined and begged me to real chocolate mousse but i told him to just give it a try and he liked it,238
131082,647495,3,it was but not we thought it was blan,37
81211,41509,5,last night i thought we had garlic bread to go with our spaghetti pie but when i went to the freezer it was empty so in desparation i pulled up this but looked at the ingredients and thought it would be very plain and blah boy was i wrong this was i baked both loaves then sliced one in half lengthwise and buttered it sprinkled on garlic and parmesan and it was better than any we have ever had before ever for such a,418
75996,207034,5,we loved this i didn t add the oyster sauce or the sprouts because i didn t have either but it was anyway i also whisked the eggs with a fork before adding to the wok this is definitely a keeper in our household,211
25903,157785,2,it was quick and but it was too bland for us we added parsley and sage while cooking it but dh still had to add red pepper flakes and we both added more salt and pepper,168
14026,117438,5,thoroughly excellent pancakes i halved the still making exactly as directed i only got 9 out of the mix i served these with real canadian maple syrup i will never settle for less again wonderful lennie they certainly my morning a one,233
101773,124050,4,these cookies were i wish the batch more but all and all i put a little chip in the middle and it tasted almost like chocolate chip very,136
44223,87652,5,really i didn t have smoked paprika either so i also used regular and it tasted fine i also only used 4 chicken breasts skinless boneless and grilled them yummm,160
169790,952803,3,5 stars for flavor 1 star for execution i m not sure what i did wrong here but my rolls were a blessed mess moving them after the second rise was impossible without the dough collapsing completely which led to flat messy buns they tasted fabulous and since i loooooove soft pretzels they ll get eaten up in no time i m going to keep trying these until i figure out the trick,374
361518,2001772492,5,this is i this with hog fish omgoodness i can t wait to it again with chicken,77
125477,819206,5,really i also added a bit of sugar and half a sweet onion to sweeten it up a little as you can tell i like it sweet,115
106954,2945656,1,i followed this to the letter and i ended up with ganache soup so upsetting what are you referring to when you state 2 cups of heavy cream like 2 tablespoons i measured everything properly and the amount of chocolate and it is just disgustingly liquidy,252
157478,2002785414,5,i love this sandwich you haven t lived until you try spreading peanut butter on the second slice of toast yum,109
63733,1628343,5,i love this salad it was a hit for our labor day picnic i left out the celery my son hates celery and added yellow bell pepper instead i also add some 1 4 cup chopped italian parsley sice we have so much of it in the garden and use twice the amount of sugar the way all the peppers and parsley mix together an flavor and looks too with all the colors,350
82486,1723381,2,i really don y see the hoopla over this bread it was extremely wet in the center and my new oven bakes perfectly quite heavy too,128
65881,598455,5,this is absolutely fabulous instead of cinnamon i used pumpkin pie spice and it was wonderful my 2 boys absolutely loved it so did i,132
3092,1337778,5,they really look like worms kinda gross but really neat i didn t have whipping cream so i substituted cool whip with a little powdered sugar to thicken the cool whip they still turned out i also put a little crushed up graham cracker to look like dirt for the brilliant idea note it is best to hold straws underwater for only about 4 seconds this allows the worms come out smoothly yet they are not turning into mush from too much heat,435
343877,1509517,5,fantastic loved it my uncle says it tasted like the gingerbread of his childhood his day for sharing,100
366140,2706055,5,i really enjoyed the green tea flavor of this cake subtle and it grows on you as you eat i think sarah jayne s picture is very accurate i did reduce the sugar to about 1 2 c took out one egg yolk reduced the butter to 1 4 c and added a half cup of applesauce still very perfect sweetness if i was feeling indulgent i might add back a bit more of the butter i served with dark chocolate covered crystalized ginger which was a pairing mine was moist though probably not as dense as others also because of the lower fat content i think i only needed to bake for about 30 minutes,575
289223,410285,5,i am making this for a graduation party beautiful display,57
223308,807381,5,excellent i was surprised it tasted that most raw foods i are just okay to pretty but this is excellent i two batches spread out in a pan sprinkled chopped walnuts on top to look more like brownies they still taste more like chewy fudge than a brownie but that are i would again in the future when wanting something chocolate and would recommend this for anyone looking for a raw dessert or not wanting refined sugar dairy or flour in their brownies,449
28148,957198,5,i used tex mex shredded cheese olive oil instead of butter and added some crushed chilis to the mix,99
166890,2042560,5,this is we all loved it we did half beef half pork no veal we put on broil for last 10 minutes to crisp the top we used all the rest of ingredients as directed we served with mushroom gravy mashed potatoes and peas will never any oyher meatloaf but this one it was extremely moist and flavorful,294
16512,51686,4,very versatile rice dish i think this would also be subbing fresh chopped mint for the parsley i had this with garlic shrimp last night and it was really well received i would recommend this as a staple for your files,217
110506,206861,5,very i used the apples from my own tree and the muffins were just you,69
54393,204124,5,just like i remember my grandmother making the only difference was she used a cut up chicken i tweaked only a little by sprinkling some garlic powder and herbes de provence along with the paprika over the tops of the chicken before baking rice came out just right and chicken was moist juicy for posting,303
29301,33443,5,sue this was incredible the chicken browned beautifuly and left lots of golden bits in the pan i did need more oil for the onion garlic stage the smells were divine i used sultana raisins and let the whole thing simmer about 10 minutes so that the raisins got and plump i then added the yogurt 1 2 of a small container directly into the pan and it the sauce and creamy we don t like it on the side added some of the cilantro in the pan but did use some to top off on the plate served with basmati rice the cilantro really makes a big difference here i would not omit it and fresh is the way to go bh who hates curry dishes had two portions,639
129040,1815368,5,if i could give these more than 5 stars i would to a pregnant lady craving peanut butter these taste like heaven i used 1 1 2 cups of sugar and they were perfect enjoy,167
278535,231137,3,a healthy and dish unfortunately the mashed potatoes are not listed in the ingredients so i wasn t sure what the correct amount is i d up my rating for sure if the were corrected,178
164393,619281,5,it was time consuming but very well worth it it is,50
105404,1006341,5,this is my favorite the old original i add another 2 cups of chex a whole can of mixed nuts and a bag of pretzel sticks,119
80156,2000883005,1,i do not understand all the rave reviews for this cookie and i agree with nikki g i followed the exactly and the cookie is nothing to write home about and worse they re kind of dry with the icing they re better but the cookie should taste on its own i can t believe i chose this over duff goldman s live and learn and go with the known professional chefs i used alton brown s for the icing which was excellent,409
201364,589777,5,very frosting it was fluffy and still dried so the cookies could be stored we used vanilla extract and heavy cream instead of whipping cream as they is all we had i will use this again,184
69725,424008,5,ok let me start by saying this not only looked but it was i used deer meat instead of burger used bread crumbs instead of crackers over all it was this will be fixed again d,173
110921,2187586,5,i halved this and also because i live in the desert and am on a budget i subbed a lot using bistro frozen clams and mussels and thawed out frozen colossal shrimp i 039 ve used these in many seafood dishes and it is really considering it was still a only thing is i felt it was a little bland i a pinch of sea salt at the end and 2 turns from a peppermill as well it needed much more flavor other than that it was,412
110688,2002250387,5,i found this as i had pistachios on hand but not pine nuts and i know you can alter nuts pesto can be also with many edible leaves i used 1 1 3 c fennel fronds and 2 3 c basil added a splash of lemon juice as i ran out of zest and it needed a tad more if your fronds get a bit dry they do easily after picked add a splash of water as you ll need too much oil otherwise they re a bit more peppery spicy but with the lemon and pistachios,435
154719,1012958,5,what an amazingly rich and savory flavor i it exactly according to the but i don t think the roux was a necessary step i served the bottle of hot sauce at the table so each person could suit their own heat level everyone else ate it with rice and raved about it i being diabetic skipped the rice and raved about it very satisfying,330
304516,224921,5,this was so an absolute must for anyone who loves chocolate chip cookies and pie you get the best of both worlds in one but unbelievably dessert i two little changes to the i reduced the butter to 1 2 cup and i added 1 tsp of vanilla to the filling pumpkin pie was always my birthday pie of choice now it s nestle toll house chocolate chip pie,343
131447,287313,3,tried this and it was o k but would omit the sugar completely next time,71
25075,814629,4,i thought this was pretty i was a little disappointed in the sauce though i was hoping for a more traditional bbq flavor this tasted more like tangy tomato soup if i this again i will probably add some chili powder garlic and extra sugar or perhaps honey to give it a more traditional barbecue sauce flavor this is just a personal preference you might love the sauce this makes,377
194125,922967,5,very it was and tasted one of the few stuffed manicotti recipes i could find that had spinach in it which we love the only thing i did differently was that i did not use any meat we like manicotti with just marinara i probably would add a little salt to the ricotta mix next time but it was without it chef we will use this again,329
16110,508949,5,cookie hard to go wrong with a nestle toll house though my 3 1 2 yr old and i these and couldn t even wait for them to cool off before we dug in for posting,156
151343,2002838270,5,wonderful and very i did add a sliced garlic clove sauteed in advance with some sesame oil,90
33563,921361,5,flavor and super to we loved the,32
139579,476278,5,i saw this in the same magazine and it for supper my mom absolutely loved it i didn t have scallions so i just used baby onions but it still was,144
149636,624412,5,i love this cake it s moist tastes like it came from a bakery plus it s to this is my favorite chocolate cake,109
129061,371746,5,my husband asks for your stuffed shells and your spicy sweet marinara sauce you,79
92302,293020,5,this is a i ve attempted cheese straws before and they just seem so greasy this one has a proportion of butter and cheese i used extra sharp cheddar from a local dairy and added an additional scant 1 4 cup of flour just my own preference then baked for about 14 minutes terrific for the oh i cut them into star shapes for the holidays instead of straws and they looked gorgeous,377
232853,348068,4,i was interested in this because i knew i only had one cup of zucchini available i modified the following reduced sugar to 3 4 cup added 1 2 tsp of ground nutmeg eliminated the banana extract because i didn t have it on hand and added an extra egg on a whim it baked almost 60 minutes in a large loaf pan at 350 degrees it turned out very nicely it sliced beautifully i think the banana extract would have helped especially since my bananas were not totally black when i mashed them,482
162167,212751,5,i modified this to suit my allergies for the rub i omitted the chili powder and i used daddy sam s original and jalapeno sawce mixed together very and i think cooking at 425 degrees them better than other recipes i have used that called for 350 degrees for,256
17753,435458,5,omg this was so succulent tried it for christmas just for something different and my boyfriend loved it would soooooooooo reccommend this thanx,143
74519,493931,1,this did not taste like cabbage rolls more like hamburger helper with cabbage instead of pasta,94
241439,732149,4,oops i forgot the rum but the still turned out well i used over 2 tsp of jerk but still wish i had used more i think it depends on how hot the jerk spice used is in the end the bbq sauce kinda liquefies and leaves mostly a jerk taste i also used thighs with drumsticks and it worked well 10 of meals for 6 hungry med students,325
13285,551267,5,as a former beef eater i had almost given up on finding a turkey burger until i tried this one the scent flavor and texture of these burger were excellent i even ate one cold right out of the refrigerator it smelled so i couldn t wait to eat it so i didn t even bother to heat it up you for an outstanding,305
98867,2001552506,5,turned out i only have one loaf pan so i thirded the glad it used ingredients i already have,92
145155,810701,4,for the it was sweet and buttery and my kitchen smell so christmasy i substituted nutmeg for the allspice though and maybe i will put in some chocolate chip the next time round too,180
252517,27798,5,this was really i it just as written and it was i think i might also try it with blueberries,92
136923,57437,5,this is a truely outstanding i was all alone last night so wanted something quick and this was it i loved it i did add some chopped cilantro and garlic to the finished dish and it was not too spicy so i am sure the kids will enjoy it as well,241
22782,1134376,5,sauce much better than the bottled in my variation i didn t use any meat and added 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar the wine i used a cabernet makes a big difference this is the second time i it,192
90086,454783,5,as my daughter is deathly allergic to sesame and can not eat tahini sesame which is usually in every store bought hummus i have been making this hummus for years it is basic and i usually have all the ingredients on hand the only thing thati ve done differently is sometimes i use greek plain yogurt or sour cream in place of the low fat yogurt it depends on what s in the fridge i also tend to add more olive oil to get to to be as smooth as possible,451
115929,2001444573,4,looks a little pale but is such an,34
109423,129041,5,quick and in my tummy kc cooker for posting this fantastic,58
130536,1802892630,5,super and tastes divine side salad for posting,46
218528,2002235144,4,it s my first time trying but it turned out pretty after s few attempts to feed the dough into my pasta machine i finally got the hang of it my dough was too moist so i had to sprinkle some more flour it seems to dry quick so to prevent breaking cook right before it dries otherwise store in airtight container in the fridge so it can stay moist,345
355707,457992,5,fantastic i absolutely loved this the lemon zest balanced the goats cheese beautifully gourmet comfort,102
101925,202432,5,very a comforting mild yet flavorful dish i added a bay leaf and bit of cayenne pepper that was the only thing different i plan on making this many more times maybe next time with chickpeas and kale or black beans and sweet potato instead of potatoes and zucchini this will be a fun one to experiment with,305
136983,402326,5,these eggs were i always used milk but since i ve tried this i ll never them like that again they were so fluffy i called my bf in see i was amazed they also tasted perfect bf had no need to add more butter ketchup etc like he always does,238

93946,2000257725,5,i loved it and it was to,24
36944,167489,5,you i use this every time i need to poach chicken,49
79865,106797,3,i did not taste the eggnog at all being a big eggnog fan that part was a disappointment i 6 very large size muffins instead of the regular size 12 and did not use muffin liners the result was a beautiful and professional looking muffin they were nicely browned all over crunchy on top and overall a muffin,305
78570,46513,3,i didn t care for the flavour of this my husband enjoyed it though but told me not to bother making it again perhaps all that orange juice it too sweet i d suggest cutting it down to 1 1 2 cups of oj,199
375809,2553172,4,i this after reading the other reviews i did 1 2 c sugar and 1 4 c brown sugar subbed dried cranberries for walnuts husband is allergic and kept everything else as stated by the original i also doubled the to two loaves one to keep and one to share at work the bread tasted but not i think i might try adding a little nutmeg next time overall a that i would try again,367
193216,559886,4,definitely takes care of the comfy cravings of mom s cooking while trimming the fat and calories an feel dinner definitely needs the lowfat cheese sprinkled on top of the potatoes,179
303802,1006466,5,these were the frosting especially quick and yet a special treat,64
79944,936900,5,my mom gave me this some 20 years ago and it looks like it has had no real changes the only thing that i have changed is now i use chicken tenderloins that way i dont need to beat thim up glad to see that this is still going around and being enjoy,247
322069,1692742,5,something familiar yet different didn t change a thing other than to double it and i m above 4 000 feet in colorado for sharing,127
60404,246898,5,for a perfect with crusty bread for a cold day i substituted a parsnip for the carrot and used chicken stock instead of vegetable will this again,145
26843,1762248,2,the carrots gave the rice a strange sweet flavor my family didn 039 t care for this,83
143481,1838803,5,loved this so and wonderful this was the first time trying sun chokes and i now plan on buying them often but i do have a note to self do not these if you have to leave the house for 24 hours these things give you unbelievable gas now that i think of it it could be fun to serve to people you don t like too much i wish i could invite my ex mother in law over for dinner but do try this it s,391
298417,2000673662,5,everyone in my family loved it we will definitely have it again,63
235204,949002,4,i enjoyed these cupcakes i a similar lemon yoghurt cake but i love cupcakes as they are for guests to eat and come as their own portion i also love lemons so i can t complain i did not even use icing just dusted with powdered sugar i am going to again with blueberries yum,272
45809,61511,5,it s a i wanted to mention that i was out of soy sauce so used worcestershire sauce instead and it came out even better it s one of those rare recipes where i almost always have the majority of the ingredients on hand always a winner,233
39822,98511,5,very quick and for a beginner very it s the only dinner my husband s ever said he wants to take to law school and show off,122
94219,222477,4,fantastic alternative to all the high cal butter and sour cream plus my family loved having their own little treasure pouches to open next time i will experiment with various spices you,185
18209,872422,4,this meal was eazy to and tasted too i toned down the spices and it still tasted,80
330918,240449,2,i m so sorry once it was done cooking we didn t even want to eat it no one in the house did it sounds so but it s not right for us,130
100472,66419,5,use hot tap water and stir with a wire whisk and use right away,63
454788,1913097,1,i appreciate your post but must ask if you have a more basic for a beginner i tried this but would up cutting my hand on the glass setting my freezer on fire and almost drowning myself on the couch again for any help you can offer,230
21205,115065,4,we have really enjoyed this twice the first time i it according to the the second time i took a few liberties as another review suggested i sauteed onion and garlic first i also added some frozen corn and a few diced fresh mushrooms i omitted the cheese and it was fine and it makes a huge pan one is enough for three separate meals for the two of us and it freezes well what s not to love,389
47391,147135,5,we re from the south so we know our fried fish but i d never it from scratch before i actually used catfish because that s what i had available and it was really really really crispy outside and juicy and flavorful inside so much rita,234
97841,1762637,4,excellent i couldn 039 t find a cake mix with pudding in it so i bought a plain white cake mix and added a box of instant vanilla pudding,137
84324,375244,5,i have alu gobi several times but this was the best i suggest that anyone who follow this uses fresh ingredients if possible and add more chilies and garlic for a kick according to my hubby this was the best alu gobi he has eaten since he came to the us definitely a keeper in our house,286
89204,1373508,5,super i serve this with either corn or flour tortillas i this for our pastor his family when they moved and they loved it he even asked for the and his wife says he rarely does that leftovers are served with rice or if you have a large family or gathering the added makes this really stretch for a super,303
326328,473821,5,i loved this chowder i used 1 lb hot italian sausage and substituted the hot sauce for a can of original ro tel and used cheddar cheese instead of swiss turned out creamy and,174
10125,724246,5,my boyfriend is begging for these cookies every week,52
84764,230020,5,i the macaroni salad version it was so dh loved it too kittencal,64
58242,156606,5,this was i added rye flour and didn t use any sugar i also cut down the serving size what a idea thanx for shareing,115
84247,751791,4,i tried it once exactly as the said and i didn t like the way it came out so i ended up modifying it a bit the next time instead of butter i used an egg wash and flour to coat the chicken before the panko part and i pan fried the strips instead it turned out marvelously crispy and flavorful i ended up eating it with honey mustard and it was a wonderful meal,359
111514,13625,5,amazingly yet after 60 minutes the chicken came out moist and tender i used regular chicken breasts i e with skin bone and also put a clove of garlic split into half on top of each breast,187
363765,2002329856,5,these are i was super nervous about the ratio of oatmeal and flour to wet ingredients but they were so i was also scared about the not having eggs which turned out to not be a problem i did also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the cooking wet ingredients a smidge more shortening replumped my fried cranberries in the microwave and replaced the 1 3 cup of flour with flax meal it worked out because flax meal seems to be a greedier dry ingredient when it comes to soaking up liquids i love these cookies so new favorite you for sharing this,547
26110,196614,5,these are biscuits i used strong bread flour and the processor the first time i over processed them a bit because i d accidentally put in a whole cup of buttermilk and had to even out the mixture with more flour they still turned out though a little more crumbly and crunchy than the second time i them using the right proportions and less processing the second time they were lighter on the inside and less crunchy both ways were be sure to save some for a breakfast of biscuits with cream pepper gravy,503
28560,43292,5,you for a wonderful like we ve all discovered stuffing cabbage is very time consuming my husband and i both enjoyed this meal very much it s just like stuffed cabbage without the hassle,185
113064,1638399,5,this was soooooo you do need a strong brew of coffee and the coffee ice cubes is a idea to prevent it from being deluded with regular ice cubes,143
70093,327989,3,not a true vegetarian as it calls for eggs and cottage cheese i m trying it for my daughter who doesn t like meats sounds like a quiche hope she likes it,153
2886,13506,5,absolutely bar none the best banana bread i have ever had you for posting,73
148440,1233208,4,totally and almost too have moderated heat as base is for most folks but too spicy for younger kids i use half can of rotel half can diced tomatoes for my kids instead and they love it full can of rotel and added hot sauce wakes it up if cooking for adults who like it hot,272
77316,335571,5,fantastic soup perfect for a chilly fall day i would say it makes more than 6 8 servings so be prepared for leftovers not that we mind,134
11237,534554,5,this was a quick last minute meal when you want something fast and homemade and don t want to mess with dinner for an hour this is very and cheap to and relatively low in fat i used fat free mushroom soup and only a half cup of cheese it was next time i will add a small can of baby peas for a veggie to go with this for posting,328
100102,138265,4,soup your right perfect for a cold night to not too thick which is will it again for sure,89
11351,154048,3,this tasted just like macaroni and cheese we found the sauce to be very very thin so we added more noodles next time i d take paige s suggestion and bake it,156
454951,1922034,5,these wer so i nearly ate all of the dough before i baked them lol the grandkids especially liked the fact that you could shape them,132
35805,1594617,5,i use this all the time i roll out the dough then place it on parchment paper on an inverted cookie sheet i add toppings and slide it all onto a pizza stone peezy,162
80470,1637261,5,this is the most perfectly incredible chocolate chip cookie ever if you love cookies that don t spread in the oven but instead stay thick rich and chewy this is utter perfection i love to bake and have used a variety of cookie recipes over the years now i ll never use another have some fun with it and try different additions you can t go wrong whenever i bake these cookies friends and family always ask how i did it you so much for sharing this it s the best,461
346699,793825,5,this couldn t have come at a better time for me i have been fighting off a cold for a few days now and i can tell that this is definitely going to help me fight it off i love the tangy flavor combination you for the reviewed for pac spring 09,242
7435,793633,5,i mostly followed this and it was outstanding everyone commented on how flavorful and the beef cabbage and carrots were here s what i did differently 1 omitted the malt vinegar because i don t like it 2 added the carrots and cabbage for the last 45 minutes of cooking so that they didn t overcook 3 upped the guiness to a full cup 8 oz 4 after removing the beef from the broth to cut off the fat i coated it with a mixture of brown sugar apple juice dijon mustard and bourbon and placed the beef in a 400 f oven for 10 minutes to glaze it simmered the additional glaze and served it on the side instead of horseradish and mustards 5 potatoes were not cooked along with the beef but instead were roasted separately at 425 f with olive oil and penzey s spices fox point seasoning absolutely 6 most important note put the spices in a tea ball infuser so that you don t have loose spices floating around everywhere it s not pleasant to bit into a whole coriander seed,963
40029,289292,5,we did this as a freezer meal and it was,40
67256,1073245,5,yum it took 1 5 hour to complete in my oven but it was worth the wait,69
69736,2001548873,4,they were pretty but they were crumbly,38
107594,491440,5,what can you say about a that calls for an entire head of garlic how about fabulous i used a pork loin roast and cooked it in a dutch oven served with black beans rice and fried plantations dinner turned out perfect the flavors are all work well together and the onions are to die for i would put this up against any cuban restaurant in town and in florida that is saying something,381
29155,287561,5,yum these taste like restaurant pancakes i don t even need to put butter or syrup on them i like them plain,107
284253,72978,5,love this i ve it twice and used red ground pepper just a pinch in substitue for the sambal oelek what flavor,109

183806,278093,5,this is a enough said,21
294521,428773,5,i have this many times now and shared it many more to simplify even more i heat the water and oil in a saucepan remove from heat and add self rising flour stirring until it makes a ball less than a minute i divide in half and 2 bottom crusts by pressing into pie plates no rolling tastes the same i am so glad i found this you you you,334
262821,678308,5,love this it s been a favorite in our family for over twenty years recently began omitting mayo and substituting cottage cheese for protein we also like cheez its or other cheesy crackers instead of ritz,203
369482,1601875,5,and filling that s quite a compliment from a guy like me who likes his meat be sure to drain the beans and tomatoes very thoroughly or it ll be really liquidy,158
175564,1512888,5,the was very different but very,31
53520,1133961,5,omg its the best rice ever esp with indian i always add a couple of more tablespoons of butter 0,96
150863,1593720,5,and so wish i would ve doubled it,33
297646,930552,5,this has been my favorite chocolate chip cookie for many years now i decrease the amount of salt to 1 2 teaspoon because i find them too salty otherwise i love making these with m m s also,188
327824,2000359632,5,this was excellent i cooked up boneless skinless breasts for about 25 minutes in the convection oven the color was tan not red so next time i may add some red coloring i was worried that 2 teaspoons of salt would be too much but it was perfect,243
66241,289319,4,turned out really well,22
14577,171854,5,i wanted to use portobello mushrooms but at 6 50 lb i just couldn t justify it so i decided to try it with white mushrooms i also used fresh spinach parmesan i two each to serve as an amuse bouche prior to dinner they were quickly gobbled everyone wanted more i was asked for the i will be making this again i them up ahead put them in the oven just prior to wanting to serve them for a next time i ll them exactly as written,425
270658,355885,5,i just had this for dinner today by cornell university dining it was soo that i had to ask for the it turns out to be the same as this one the only difference is that there is only 1 tbsp of butter and 1 3 cup of chives and the servings is listed as 8 it was so refreshing and a wonderful break to writing an essay on global security,333
40837,101381,5,we really liked this one might go for a bit lower of a pasta sauce ratio though it wasn t as coated as we would have liked,122
39931,56447,4,this was a blast from the past it has been years since i had this so much for posting it follow the directions as written and you can t miss i did substitute fresh sweetened whipped cream for the non dairy whipped topping,221
243415,478599,5,reviewed for rsc 10 a definite favorite at my house my husband is a big fan of pineapple and he was over the moon with this everything worked out very well the only substitution i was to use canola instead of veg oil as it is what i has on hand i plan to this dish again as my dh and ds both requested that i do so lucky for them because i want it again too,357
78814,2466264,2,i feel the filling was too rich and didn t like the crunchiness of the onions i think i over did it on the garlic i like the concept of doing a filling and rolling it up with a crescent roll maybe next time i will use onion powder on the garlic and add more chicken and use condensed chicken soup on the cheese,310
176905,1800040229,5,the best ever dill pickle spears i love that the is broken down per jar makes for conversion,92
17083,804329,4,i used half whole grain flour and brown sugar i didn t realize what a difference it would until i it completely according to but using brown sugar and whole grain i thought this was the best bread i ever tasted for sharing,222

68553,140057,5,this is the first loaf of bread from my bread machine that was really excellent i love this cheap i ll be making this one several times each week without a doubt my kids even loved it,183
30391,1800844367,5,this was so fantastic i halved the since i only 2 chicken breasts will definitely be making this again,102
215853,734103,5,did a baked version and it was incredible used this for the filling and dipping sauce then used this baked crisp coated mushrooms 228623 for the coating houlihan s left our area a few years ago have been missing these shrooms ever since,236
11220,307403,5,i ll give this one a ten star baking is my passion i am superpicky about recipes i use for baking from scratch and if you are superpicky like me then you can trust me when i tell you that this one is a winner and a keeper very the cookies come out i would leave the dough in the fridge for atleast 30 minutes or if i were to refrigerate the dough for 15 minutes i would put it in the freezer makes the dough easier to handle makes a cookie,439
63785,450060,4,this tea was but it tasted like normal ice tea according the box directions to me i used 1 1 2 cups of sugar and just filled my lage pitcher up and it was and sweet i m not sure what the baking soda does though i used one family size peach tea bag refreshing drink,264
62483,80308,5,the ginger vinegar adds what i have always been missing ted,59
186546,54728,5,this is fabulous rich and incredibly chocolatey but so to i it at my mother s request for her 60th birthday last weekend and it was a hit one major change i due to non availability of hazelnut meal was to substitute the hazelnut with 1 2 almond meal and 1 2 coconut flour which worked beautifully and i will do again this is definitely a keeper,344
139248,157332,5,such a i followed the as printed a first for me lol i loved the tangy sweet blend of flavors the lemon really brightened things and the dijon and parmesan added depth i loved it and my family loved it even those who aren t fond of broccoli yep i used broccoli instead of broccoflower i highly recommend this,307
50484,105262,5,loved it it twice in a week served with garlic bread,52
198797,740470,5,needed to use up some bananas and strawberries this was so one big loaf and 3 mini loaves for sharing note the mini loaves only had to cook for 45 minutes for sharing,166

263659,1800522590,5,wow so to and so i can 039 t stop eating it i doubled the this is supposed to be saved for christmas but i just may need to another batch,137
8513,424672,1,i this with regular sherry as well and then added some half and half near the end it turned out horribly the sauce was mostly oil and had a vinegar like taste the coating on the chicken got really soggy i browned the chicken at medium high until lightly browned and simmered at medium low heat was that not right sorry i m pretty new to cooking,344
86512,192623,5,i this for a wine weekend getaway recently and it was very to and goes well with veggies crackers pretzels toast or even straight off of a spoon,144
125519,480970,5,wow i really messed these up lol i these with refrigerated dough and they flattened out when i cooked them my daughter and her friend who doesn t like tacos ate some of these right away and loved them next time i will ensure the dough is chilled in the freezer prior to putting together and cool the meat in the fridge there are some in the freezer that i am sure will be for the,379
416497,2000154789,5,first time making this sauce and it came out i plan to freeze the rest of it for another,88
226021,593159,3,these had flavor but turned out a little dry i like how healthy they are and that you use molasses instead of sugar,115
15166,35499,5,excellent and not overly rich hubby and daughter loved it i added more mushrooms and an half a cup peas and carrots,115
141871,440010,4,just this for the first time and it s got a really flavour garam masala works well i found the fresh coriander a little unappetising although the flavour was,157
193100,470447,5,these to take to work for my birthday they were next time i ll use a regular muffin pan,87
91160,541539,5,excellent marinade have done it twice already with marvelous results still have to try it with honey instead of maple syrup,123
47961,282673,5,i have this salad several times now and love it i use the french puy lentils but don t cook them as long as the states i use dried mint and also reduce the garlic since in this it is not cooked i founf that this makes leftovers the flavors blend and intensify i plan to this a lot over the summer,296
4627,755411,5,this soup was wonderful very and to prepare i had never had tortilla soup before but my entire family devoured this,115
145953,89514,5,holy cow these are so i have these for a bakesale at work and now the challenge will be to keep myself from eating them all ten minutes in my oven is absolutely perfect i wouldn t even put them in for two minutes longer,219
104799,373178,5,we love these and these with soup and salad routinely you,57
24072,227932,4,we had never a parikash before and we did really enjoy this the flavor was different but it kind of grew on us after a few bites it was really leftover too thaniks for the,171
111689,234727,5,we really enjoyed this flavor combination i did start the dish by browning 3 slices of diced bacon then proceeded as instructed combination of sweet salty sour and meat,168
104014,8199837,5,i served this on top of rice to a meal lt br gt this is a i was a little leary about adding milk to the mix and it didn 039 t look all or that appetizing it turned out the milk allowed the meatballs to stay moist i used this for dinner instead of an appetizer for dinner i changed the just a little i seasoned my ground turkey a little with seasoning salt pepper garlic powder onion powder and a little crushed red peppers i added a little hickory bbq sauce to the mix which gave it flavor to give it some heat i added crushed red peppers to the sauce as well i used ground turkey which was after i added the meatballs to the sauce i cut up a red green yellow pepper and onion and sauteed them in olive oil in a separate skillet i also had some canned pineapple chunks and i drained the the pineapples and cut them up a little smaller and added them to the mix this gave it an asian fusion if i had some sesame seeds i would have probably sprinkled that in the mix as well lt br gt dish for a party or dinner yum,1012
149764,430188,4,for sharing,11
214985,507034,5,done these twice and i d never marinaded before my dad told me real men don t marinade he s gone now and boy did he miss out on a lot of steak over the years these are fabulous some extra marinade and did a couple more before freezing them for another time now they ll continue to marinade as they defrost kittencal,315
155186,492365,2,this was way too salty next time i will skip the chips at the bottom and just use this as a dip or taco filler i would also suggest salt free refried beans or low sodium taco seasoning i liked the texture and even though i m only giving it 2 stars i thought it has potential,274
88753,1893397,5,this is i didn t use the corn flakes because i wanted it to be really low carb to add flavor i mixed in about a 1 2 cup of meat substitute and instead of onion powder i used a vegetarian meat loaf seasoning packet that i found at the store this was so with a mushroom gravy that i and a side of vegetables,305
99247,1198738,5,excellent will be making this many times in the future,54
19461,21730,4,the soup has an excellent flavour however i only sifted parts of the soup through the filter i didn t want to waste the ingredients the soup wasn t silky smooth but myfamily still likes it i guess it s just a personal preference thing,234
30871,56141,5,this is a lovely dish suitable for guests and enough for every day the sauce is light refreshing and the only modification i was to lightly brown my chicken breasts in olive oil prior to placing them in the oven for a cher,222
494631,2420655,5,we tried this and loved it you for such an and,46
13252,154522,5,i have this three times so far and our family loves it we use a prepared pie crust instead of crescent and add chopped cooked turkey bacon to the then we top it with spaghetti sauce when serving,194
54369,2609244,4,home style soup perfect for this cold january day served with fresh bread,73
18266,144897,3,this had a flavor but for us was too dry i added a bunch of extra butter because i didn t know what else to do with it,118
44938,2000999131,5,this a few weeks ago and it turned out i cooked it in the turkey and everyone loved it only substitution was no celery or mushrooms picky family making again today so much for this,180
88914,1917446,5,and added some parmesan during the last minute of baking to some of them and topped with bacon jam once they were out mmm mmm,125
224949,453216,5,this has to be the best homemade joe i ve or ever had and i have many different recipes before this is a keeper and one i will probably use all of the time dh loved them also oh and i used the stove top method of cooking them,225

325180,814629,5,i think the birds in my yard will really enjoy these this mixture is really sticky so i decided to not roll these out instead i just flattened it down with the back of a wooden spoon and my hands i let the layer dry for a few minutes to harden up a little before i attempted to cut them i used the rim of a drinking glass to cut them into the round shape i turned them every hour and after about 5 hours they were dry enough to hang my birds you for this for my 3 chefs 2009,474
12624,2378219,4,i don t know what i m doing wrong i have tried at least 5 bloomin onion recipes and techniques i can t seem to get it right i bought a bloomin onion cutter the raw onion looks beautiful but then when it comes to frying it i literally destroy it this batter seems with what i was able to salvage out of my onion i can t fault the for my failure,343
43023,321965,5,and so my favourite kind of,27
80621,2002277573,5,i don t normally leave reviews but i an account just for this this has become a absolute favorite of my family and neighbors i have found that if you have picky eaters you can add one mashed banana into the squash mix just sure it is two cups of mashed whatever you use or you can substitute banana totally i don t add the nuts because of picky eaters you for this fyi one batch makes me 3 loaves,396
12360,71605,5,this is the best macaroni and cheese i ve ever i don t see making all those three and five cheese jobs it s mac cheese for crying out loud what a little impromptu cheese sauce with the cream cheese this one has i gave it 5 stars it s that it s wholesome and i think you could very well add other things to it a main dish it wasn t difficult i used only 2 tablespoons of butter for the sauce for expediency i also left off the bread crumbs and used shredded cheese rather than cubed but i think i d take the time to use cubed cheese next time i added shredded cheese on top and only baked it to bubbly goodness i don t like browned scorched cheese,646
39466,278184,5,this is better than any bar b q place i have ever eaten at so much pork it was after cooking my husband takes out meat and shreds it then puts meat back in sauce shredded and it soaks up all of the juice we love it,214
72559,106846,5,scandigirl skafte daughter s boyfriend gives this a 5 star rating and a two thumbs up now i can this anytime i want to enjoy and to surprise my girlfriend,154
13847,43139,5,the best all of the ingredients mix to a super dressing tangy and no way to improve it,86
459303,1942289,5,love this no one knew it was gluten free note that i would suggest to put the cakes and frosting into the fridge before assembly this it more stable and you can put more between the layers,188
108893,433255,5,i had prepared this dish for many of my vietnamese friends and they enjoyed it immensely however i had prepared the stew in a slow cooker which seems to the beef a little more tender i also added a chili pepper for a little spice potatoes added are also acceptable,264
428894,417605,5,living in spain you immediately get a feel of how this tastes before you even start of all the recipes for this dish you will find i have now cooked this twice and with the exception of adding the almost compulsory bay leaf off my own tree this is truly as as any spanish celeb chef could produce wonderful brian i served this with a jacket potato and a little rice to absorb the sauce will come down to see you soon promise,424
227043,650039,5,some changes to this for a low sodium meal instead of soy sauce i used a 1 4 cup water and 2 packages of no soduim beef bouillon used carrots potatoes sweet potatoes onions and cabbage for vegetables also used low sodium bacon dh and i loved it have it several times using different meats nimz for a,299
38620,293671,5,i these this morning for myself and 4 kids they were a huge hit just the right amount of everything definately a keeper for posting,131
17987,685017,4,this was but i agree with some of the other posters that there is something missing as written i used homemade chicken stock roasted my butternut squash and used lots of fresh sage but i couldn t quite put my finger on what was missing i used another poster s advice to add some curry powder and that it much better,315
87998,266476,4,this is a fun one it s to prep and has flavor i did not add the hot sauce as it called for and would use less white pepper the next time around i thought the pepper overwhelmed the other flavors just a bit cilantro is a addition we used this for a hawaiian themed supper club side dish and everyone raved about it i gave the out to several others and plan to it again for thanksgiving dinner as a little twist on traditional sweet potatos,438
26370,2002404759,5,love it i found the frosting bland so i did add powdered sugar about a cup dash of sea salt vanilla beans orange zest and a dash of orange liqueur to the frosting perfect and the method was worth the small effort i cooled the cake in the freezer after leaving on the counter for 15 minutes and then chilled the frosting in freezer for 10 minutes frosted beautifully absolutely will use this again and again you,410
141983,1908594,5,they 039 re not lying better than olive garden which shocks us because we have yet to find one better change ingredients not a drop added grilled chicken that 039 s it loved it,176
56526,669590,5,for some of you frustrated reviewere there are a few necessary steps that you must go through before you put your ingredients together and put the item in the oven 1 read the 2 read the reviews to see if you need to modify anything 3 read the again after you have any modifications 4 get all utensils and ingredients together into one place 5 read the this rece ipe needed no modifications it turned out fine as written i ve been making this bread for years and have never tired of it,484
229150,2001295464,2,this was way too sweet my family couldn t eat but just a few bites the brown sugar is not needed with the ketchup,113
116930,1749545,5,i love it and juicy,19
193880,457108,5,this meal was deliciously different the only alterations we were substituting the 2 large tomatoes for grape tomatoes and using fat free half and half for the full fat version this was really excellent and only took 40 minutes you so much for posting,250
122801,452576,5,tasted like the real thing just be sure to cover when in the freezer because they quickly get that frostbitten taste,116
48356,1245964,5,i love baking and yesterday my son was asking me to some soft chocolate chip cookies i have a for double chocolate chip cookies they are time cosuming and the dough has to be refrigerated overnight so i went looking and came across this and read the reviews and thought i would try it they are one of the best recipes i tried and they are soft and chewy and the was perfect i highly recommend to everyone,404
99523,530324,1,extremely bland looked when everything was added in the crock pot smeeled wonderful cooking even looked really pretty but it seemed that maybe all the flavors cooked out i ve had this happen before with crockpot cooking i think this would be a stirfry i ll try it that way next with something green broccoli or sugar snap peas tossed in for crunch and color,357
120813,399465,5,i m not buying frozen cheese puffs again this is the best cheese puff i ve tasted these babies should come with a warning highly addictive they re still with dried thyme leaves too i didn t use any paper or flour if your puff pastry comes separated by a plastic sheet just work straight from it chill and they come straight off the plastic onto a lightly greased surface with veg oil to avoid sticking evelyn for sharing,420
38298,1210365,5,no wonder there are so many reviews this soup is wonderful my family raved about it i might have used more kale than the calls for other than that i no changes cycle michael,173
115086,1213271,5,excellent very very very and,28
67447,460854,5,this was exactly what i was looking for i had one lonely zucchini in the fridge and some baby carrots that needed to be used up the amount of both was just right i added 1 2 tsp salt instead of the full tsp and omitted the walnuts the loaves took 1 hour to bake in total perhaps because it was a rainy day dh raised his eyebrows when i told him what i was baking but after trying a slice he helped himself to another an excellent bread with a hot cuppa tea or a cold glass of milk,480
40533,58619,5,wow this was it s pretty similar to the i ve always used but i wanted to try this because i love monterey jack cheese it for a change,133
155056,2001077197,5,this turned out and moist i added more salt and replaced half of the cayenne with additional black pepper yum,109
21033,650857,5,i this for a family christmas party and they loved it although i d say a little goes a long way had some leftover but it was gone the next day to prepare i will be making this again for posting,193
21527,2104905,1,i was really excited to try this because a local restaurant makes a clam bisque i was incredibly disappointed when i tasted the i ended up adding 4 cubes of chicken bouillon some salt and some garlic it was edible but still not at all what i was hoping for i will not be making this again,288
93373,1871885,5,this is a meal in one i add carrotts and used french onion soup instead of cream of anything and it was a winner with everyone my daughter complained pof the pork chops always being to dry well not this one it is so moist and the veggies so flavorful i am going to it again tonite and add some cabbage well see how it turns out this is a wonderful dinner since you have veggies meat and gravy all in one,403
155186,1265539,4,i would give 3 1 2 stars if i could i thought it was better than average my mom thought average bf thought very i used regular tortilla chips for the bottom instead of corn chips and i thought this really worked well not soggy at all it was pretty not the absolute best but pretty decent,287
151372,542891,4,we really enjoyed these very to,31
111325,327351,5,this was a very quick and tasting i was in a hurry and used a little bit of onion soup mix instead of onions i will use this many times you,139
177702,292812,5,very flavor i loved this i left out vinegar and mushrooms per my taste and added extra cheese loved the blend of light fresh tastes in this it would work very for a summer company chicken dish for posting,204
257931,578233,5,this tilapia is so to and tastes phenominal i mine with fresh sauteed onion but that is the only thing i changed when making these so much,138
103215,395713,5,wooooowwwww i was sooo impressed with this chinese has always been my forte and this just blew me away really tangy and flavorful i really suggest doubling the sauce except for the zest and yes it will be a lot of sugar i also like to thicken the sauce and add the chicken at the last minute to preserve the crispiness i m always hesitant to serve any other dishes with this because they pale in comparison although the says serves 6 my boyfriend and i can finish most of it by ourselves if you want to feed a family use more chicken yum,537
164081,250716,4,this is a really exciting its perfect for spring i first found it in a swiss cooking magazine and tried it because it was seasonal and i had strawberries on hand the mix of flavours is so delicate and it shouldnt be overlooked because of the ingredients the colour is beautiful one has to be a bit adventerous but its worth it,326
219319,754772,5,i cooked some fresh peeled potatoes in with these greens and had with 49786 for one heck of a meal we love dandelions and always look forward to having our fill while they are in the stores in the late spring and early summer i blanched and froze some dandelions this year to have enough for the rest of the year we love them so much right here,344
67711,432296,5,i these for a hawaiian themed party we do not eat beef so i substituted turkey delish will again,96
12458,421184,5,what a i added a can of chopped green chilie s to the onion and garlic saute i also added chopped bacon to the cream sauce i topped it with parsley and paprika and served it over pasta this is sauce sure and do not over cook the chicken i cooked it without the sauce for about hour and half and then with the sauce for a hour and turned out perfect for a,354
12458,264142,5,definetly will serve 6 the sauce tasted wonderful and very to put together i added a couple extra garlic cloves just my preference we re a garlic loving family i served over rice this is a keeper this again and it was again the next day we shredded the chicken and warmed it up with sauce in a pan and fajitas with just added some fresh shredded chees and onions and it a very second meal next time i may even sautee green pepper onions to put on the fajitas,458
53301,2000509177,2,followed the to a t and they were flat and were that soft they were running through the cake rack think next time i will use less margarine also to get them like any sort of biscuit i had to cook them for 20 minutes they were very chocolatey though,248
203524,79877,5,yum rita i love these caramelized onions the sherry really makes the dish i used fresh thyme and rosemary from my garden and followed your to a t everything just marries together i will definitely add these to my rotation and devoured for zwt5 for hell s kitchen angels,269
64635,56130,5,very flavor to i used onion powder instead of onions and let it brown a bit for a roasted onion flavor in the future i think i ll use crushed tomatoes instead of diced ones,172
263262,117974,5,very my family loved it i added taco seasoning to the meat along with cumin also added green chilies to it,106
52253,486936,5,i miss mayberry sitting on the porch eating mom s chicken and dumplins wow these took me back to keep it more like i remembered mom s to be i omitted the red peppers and onions and added green peas and cubed potatoes reminded me a lot of chicken pot pie so for posting,268
74594,1250824,5,we this about 5 times during the holidays last year and it was a huge winner with everyone to whom we served it just bought the ingredients today for the thanksgiving crowd again this year i doubt i 039 ll ever buy real baileys again this is decadently i use egg beaters instead of eggs 1 4 cup per egg so we don 039 t worry about the raw egg factor we prefer brandy in place of the whiskey try it you 039 ll love it too,420
144067,71463,5,wow these are chocolate treats my family loves chocolate and went crazy over these i a few alterations i doubled the and only had 300 ml cans of sweetened condensed milk vanilla so i added a little milk as a substitute i also added about 4 5 tbsp of kahlua i used baking chocolate chopped instead of chocolate chips topped the bars with chopped milk chocolate for a really smooth finish i only used 12 oz even though i doubled the for the base i used a high quality cocoa i cooled these for 30 minutes on cooling racks and then cooled in the fridge for an hour before slicing the as is would not taste any less so i would either version the baker s chocolate merely melts better and is a higher quality taste,708
27751,78770,5,just terrific i substituted 1 2 cup each of flour and cornmeal and 1 2 teas baking powder for the hush puppy mix it worked out just fine served this as the main course in a vegetarian dinner used sour cream as garnish the pea cake went well with spanish rice and apple raisin salad will these again,298
53508,1124767,5,my family including my pickiest daughter loves this so much that i am making it at least 3 times a week however i one addition tarragon it gives the chicken a bit more flavor by itself and also complements the grapes wonderfully love the worcestershire sauce too,262
28208,294705,5,as directed and it was very and,31
141871,158308,5,absolutely i used water instead of chicken stock and i was a bit short on fresh coriander greens so added a bit of fresh dill chopped also also added a touch of salt to help flavors blend kids didn t really like it but they just don t like thick blended soups and especially not carrot soup sigh dh and i loved it i boiled the carrots while doing my aerobic exercises and then just before the kids came home from schoool assembled the rest of the soup very quick once the carrots are cooked which is another plus definitely a keeper,532
497784,2788347,5,i liked this i used coconut milk because that was all i had on hand i will it again the kids loved it,101
186886,1800370554,4,love this soup so rich i it on the stove top by boiling my potatoes then adding the broth milk and about a tablespoon of minced red onions i also used leftover thanksgiving ham minced in place of bacon just because that 039 s what i had on hand don 039 t skip on that sour cream dollop before serving,300
104248,236760,5,tried this tonight on a homeade bun that i hollowed out very texture not rubbery,80
8603,1590589,5,absolutely using 3 large bananas is key to getting a banana flavor,66
69371,98394,5,to prepare i substituted soy cheddar and sausage to reduce fat i like that so many different vegetables could be used,117
50445,21432,4,i ll reiterate what folkdancer said very and not spectacular but i will definitely it again due to its taste to effort ratio,124
328540,1241836,5,i have other seasoned salt recipes before but i like the addition of cornstarch and the amounts on this one the best i used slightly less than the 1 2 cup salt suggested only because i don t use it often and i read the review that said they used less and it was fine i it to use in pannan s perfect southern fried chicken and boy was it ever the best fried chicken i had ever and the season salt worked perfectly from the woman who is such a snoot she likes to her own bisquick,477
85629,2000121199,5,scallops for the first time at easter this was a success best ever we were 11 and nothing was left my son said of everything i had for the easter dinner the scallop potatoes was the best this is a keeper for sure,212
274523,1582498,5,i changed the raw cranberries to 1 cup of sweetened dried cranberries and the oat flour to unbleached white it turned out well and was pleasantly sweet try to use the required steel cut oats it s the soul of the would again quite,229

184465,176843,3,this was but perhaps a little too rich for my taste i this for valentine s dinner for my dh and i i used boneless skinless breasts and rolled the stuffing into the center securing it with toothpicks otherwise i no changes i would this again but would sub in chic broth for the wine or perhaps half broth half wine i also think i would lightly roll the chicken breasts in an egg wash and bread crumbs brown them slightly and then bake for a,439
115222,43152,5,flavor i used olive oil and it turned out,41
43475,53448,5,i this with fat free sour cream i also substituted bread crumbs for crunched up crackers since i had no bc served over pasta with broccoli rolls and fruit salad meal i am rating this so high because my family loved it my kids ate it wow and my husband said this was one to again the chicken was super moist i actually cut it with the side of my fork for posting,361
44990,97073,4,i love the way it turned out we didn t care for the flavor though maybe it was the worcestershire sauce i m not sure i am going to use this as a base though and change the seasonings and try it again,199
11913,134190,5,absolutely this for a for a cool treat for the grandkids they all loved it it for mother s day actually did 4 pies and there was none left my nephew tried to steal one of them this is so frozen or slightly thawed for sharing this wonderfully and definite keeper,261

29022,122577,5,this is an excellent coffee cake i prepared it in a 10 spring form pan it did require about 10 more minutes baking time this way but the presentation was so well worth it our whole family enjoyed this special treat with a hot cup of coffee,239
90183,71854,5,philbo this deserves 5 stars just for your compelling description of orvieto and your time in italy i haven t been there but your words painted a beautiful picture in my mind i am going to lemon ice and let my imagination take over,231

317548,383205,4,this was a different way for me to cook salmon it was but i felt like it was missing just a bit of something not sure what i will definitely use this again i will just experiment a little,187
16687,1797076,4,so and like other reviewers i ended up with a little too much liquid but the taste was perfect next time i ll just use a bit less salsa it was to walk into the kitchen and smell the cooking it tastes like i spent hours on it instead of tossing it all in this morning,266
63892,110402,5,this was so to and very everybody in my family loved it i used ingredients i had on hand so i ended up with yellow cake mix raspberry jello vanilla pudding and dream whip i am sure many other variations would also be,216
265817,304870,5,we adore pumpkin pie but a pie crust is problematic for the low salt fat etc plan and this fit the bill perfectly texture and taste i it with skim evaporated milk splenda and the just egg whites i liked that it didn t need a water bath baked it in a rectangular pyrex baking dish it took about 10 extra minutes or so but that worked out fine too for the,353
7163,108151,5,try as i might i could not screw up this i was making a large batch for my office luncheon and thought i had 3 cups of sweet potatoes mixed the flour salt and baking powder then discovered i only had just 2 cups of sweet potatoes nothing to do but press forward the biscuits were so light and fluffy in addition i misread the and added 2 1 2 tsp x3 of salt instead of baking powder i recognized my error and fished out as much salt as i could but the tolerated a lot of salt i used shortening as recommended i will be serving them with candied bacon butter and they are yum,573
120416,1152956,5,the whole family absolutely loves these they are so to heat one up and eat on the way to work i was a little concerned that the egg filling might be a little messy but it s not at all the cheese really does glue everything together i have these using sausage reg bacon maple bacon and diced ham and i really like the maple bacon it gives these a flavor nebraskagirl these are a lifesaver,387

41739,2001695798,5,this was the best meatloaf i have ever had and the only thing i did different was 1 25 lbs of lean ground beef and 25 or ground pork,132
393377,76475,5,absolutely fabulous we will have this again i used a full tablespoon of sriracha for the chili sauce which for a heat i suggest if you have timid tastebuds use less or a milder version i added broccoli for color and stir fried that for about a minute before adding the other vegetables the sauce smelled heavenly so i extra which i added in at the end cooking with the rest of the ingredients for an extra minute that gave us enough to coat the rice this is an excellent you i mpat,481
482586,396078,4,i am always excited to try new maple recipes because i am a lover of real maple syrup how coincidental that i came across this as it just happens to be peak maple tapping season in the northeastern usa this cake is light and fluffy with delicate ginger flavor moist fruit and topped with a subtle maple glaze i actually substituted apples for the pears since my hubby unwittingly served the pears i was saving to our youngsters for breakfast today being a maple lover i would have liked this cake to have a stronger maple flavor the glaze has a maple flavor and makes the cake glisten like a precious gem but i 039 d like a little stronger maple flavor in the cake itself i also found myself wanting a little more moisture with the cake so i should have heeded your advice and served it with ice cream the next time i bake this cake using pears i 039 ll serve it with maple walnut ice cream or maple whipped cream for sharing this baby kato it was scrumptious,959

141353,291292,5,my dh thought this was very and delish i used openpit bbq sauce and mexican blend cheese i also sprinkle some onion and herb mrs dash on the chicken i did top with the mushrooms and i baked it at 375 for 30 minutes my dh said i did have to it again lol you,256
60350,2002197181,5,this turned out it only took me about 20 minutes to and it s definitely one of the best bowls of macaroni and cheese i ve had i used one cup of colby jack and one cup of tilamook medium cheddar and it came out perfect for me super and,234
89204,1809065,5,forget 5 stars i give it 10 not only is it soooo its soooo i didn t have much time so i pressure cooked the chicken and then threw it all into the crock pot to heat up and served with rice and sauted bell peppers and onions my husband and i have a wonderful local mexican restraunt that serves a polo con creama dish that i have looked everywhere for the recipie and this dish tastes exactly like it i m so excited to have it and have already shared it with others,464
449452,2002744176,1,not very bland,14
139579,545684,5,i ve been wanting to this ever since i got the magazine in the mail a couple of years ago finally got around to trying it and i sure am glad i did a little involved but totally worth it,185
106618,240154,5,fantastic my new stuffed shells to eclipse all others it enough stuffing for many more than 12 oz shells,104
46365,127500,5,the best sangria ever,21
80724,489929,5,everyone loved it though my potatoes turned black on the bottom and i am not sure why i added 1 4 tsp garlic powder sprinkle on top parmession cheese i subbed 1 tbls powder onion into the sauce mozzarella cheese 9 x 13 glass pan,228
11463,109055,5,all i can say is yum o do i sound like rachael ray this is so absolutely and to i did add some salt tabasco and a dash of onion and garlic powder just personal preferences my son begs for this dish serve it with salad or country green beans and cornbread and you have a wonderful comforting meal it makes lots so there are some leftovers sure you let it sit 5 10 minutes after baking somehow it improves the flavor and texture greatly,434
19069,229448,5,followed the except for the pecans blech and this was keeps for a long while too were slowly chipping away at it for the,120
73710,125808,5,for the clear directions i had never roasted garlic before i tried this i didn t have sea salt so used kosher,109
26988,1533,5,these were i tripled the without a problem the sauce on these i believe the party my husband suggested making it again this week and serving it over rice or noodles i am going to do that as well to bad i can only vote once lol for such a,237
34784,631030,5,this a very pretty loaf of bread i used canned pinto beans and added two tbsp of ground flax seed i like to sneak healthy stuff into my kids diet and crisp on the outside soft yet fluffy on the inside i will definately this again,229
70533,491949,5,yum i had some leftover honeybaked ham in the freezer and used it in this even my pikiest eater loved it,104
24089,256501,5,loved this i added a little open pit bbq sauce and a package of cocktail weiners it s very filling,98
59699,765539,5,i ve tried four different scone recipes recently and this is the best by far it was a little time consuming the first time through but the prep has gotten quite short after making them half a dozen times or so i have substituted skim and 2 milk and both work beautifully i have also substituted a couple of tablespoons of orange juice for half the milk and added some orange rind and dried cranberries that dough was a little stickier but had a result for a final batch i omitted the juice and added the orange rind and cranberries then sprinkled a little sugar on top before baking excellent result i do recommend using the cookie cutter or cutting into wedges as they do not very pretty drop scones but the flavor and the balance between flakiness and density is perfect one of our new favorites,797
367529,147600,5,this is and i ve it twice already daughter who eats alot of fish asked for the exactly as directed except used crushed red pepper and sprinkled with lemon juice before baking you for this,187
235379,1635210,5,i needed a brownie to take to a reunion this as indicated by the author using a 9x13 glass dish let it sit to cool before placing a icing on the brownies the texture and flavor were although i thought the brownies were thin my second batch turned out again the as indicated except this time i used a 7and 1 2 x 11 and 3 4 in baking dish allowed the brownies to cool prior to icing brownies turned out chewy and with some depth to them this will be my go to for brownies from now on flavor and best when heated for a few seconds in the microwave,544
117317,492287,5,these are i used 1 cup white flour and 1 3 4 whole wheat flour and it worked well i had a bag of trail mix with peanuts m m s and raisins and i used that in place of chocolate chips and they were my 20 yr old son couldn t stop eating them for an excellent,255
27145,316208,4,very to and tastes i used tinned peaches for a variation,56
110064,1122315,5,it for super bowl the night before tonight and have to a double batch cuz hubby ate it all already so that is the best test for me you,134
69485,524219,5,i used a 12oz bag of frozen cranberries and 1 2 of a pouch of pectin i don t see bottles of pectin anymore here this set up nicely and is so pretty also tastes very for posting,176
145464,1567721,4,i think the reason this includes lemon juice is because many vegan cheese sauce recipes call for something called rejuvelac which is by soaking whole wheat grains letting them sprout a day grinding them with water and then letting the resulting mixture ferment a day on the counter before straining it s kind of sour but it s not at all like lemon juice my advice is if you re not making rejuvelac leave out lemon juice i ve many vegan cheese recipes and if i don t have a batch of rejuvelac on hand i just deal with i and omit it they all come out well real secret is the nutritional yeast that s what gives it the cheesy flavor also if you soak the raw cashews for at least 2 hours before making this sauce will come out much smoother almost like melted velveta also reduce the water to a 1 to 1 1 2 ratio cashews to water you can add additional water to thin if you need to much easier to thin a thick sauce than to thicken up a thin sauce you can leave out cornstarch if you follow this method and best of all you don t have to cook it if you prepare it this way perfect for raw enthusiasts several dashes of tumeric will it yellow if you re concerned about aesthetics,1172
131295,1413162,5,absolutely loved this so to and so little ingredients things i usually already have on hand i love cooking in my cast iron skillets and this will be very often my husband loved it,179
54257,588079,5,without wanting to sound redundant this is really a meatloaf i it as written but in place of the salt and pepper i added a package of lipton beefy mushroom dry soup mix i was not sure if i really had 1 1 2 lbs of ground beef so i mixed 1 2 cup cream and 1 egg together in a measuring cup so that i could just add as needed and in the correct proportions i did end up using all of it and it was plump not runny i really like using the soup mix as seasoning but just my taste i the topping as directed and baked 1 hr 350 this meatloaf was tender and i was shocked this is my go to meatloaf you so much nita,604
9780,404077,5,very to put together put into the crock pot and leave for 8 hrs the taste was the maple syrup gave it a sweet taste but not overpowering just right definitely will be making this many times prairie moon girl,207
10269,1371372,5,these cookies are i was searching for a basic peanut butter cookie and came across this i followed it exactly its wonderful and hubby approved,142
131399,335469,3,this may have been operator error but i could not get the ketchup or cornflakes to really stick to the hotdogs i finally gave up rinsed them off and baked em naked the concept seemed especially for a home daycare like mine what s better than not having to buy a bun but alas it didn t work for me and it was really more work than i anticipated probably won t try again unless i have more time and can figure out how to get them to stick anyway,443
277396,437974,5,this was i this for lunch with a salad my daughter and i both loved this for a for please review my tag,103
12458,2001574271,5,woa this is i just it i am following you and other cooking websites for making recipes and share link with you to find best recipes video tutorial also available for cooking http howprices com category recipes,209
42846,1625948,4,the correct assembly of this sandwich is important following the picture on the primanti bros website the warmed meat goes on first with the melted cheese covering the meat then and this is the critical part you stack on the fries the melted cheese helps to keep the potatoes from falling out next comes the cole slaw and then the tomatoes top with a second slice of bread cut in half and wrap in paper the cole slaw dressing soaks into the potatoes and seasons the tomatoes at the same time but doesn t the bread soggy a whole meal inside 2 slices of bread,557
89096,89240,5,woah these are dangerous you won t be able to stop eating them i only half a because i had 1 cup of chocolate chips the first day i them they were just okay not spectacular but the second day they were 5 times better they seemed a bit chewier and richer i m not sure why but next time i ll them a day ahead of time they don t have a strong peanut butter taste the chocolate flavor is more dominant have a big glass of milk ready for these,438
217610,63858,5,these were i also added chocolate chips in addition to the nuts so much for a lisa,82
162334,464333,5,this was i didn t have any lemon so i just doubled up on the lime and it turned out perfectly i also added a pinch of cayenne for a little kick i served it with corn on the cob for the,184
182155,1550977,1,although these cookies may be this is not the dr siegel s contains beef in it yeah look at the box i m looking for the authentic guess i ll have to try to come up with one on my own,181
56592,182453,5,i a batch of these little dumplings this morning for dd s class it was a hit they were and to they didn t need any dipping sauce the only change i was adding some minced garlic ginger 1 tsp of sesame oil and a dash of white will definitely again they re a perfect party appetizer for posting,291
810,68710,5,a batch yesterday and they re gone my son and his friends asked for another batch i two changes i used butter flavored shortening that s all i had and dark brown sugar,167
182382,1124612,5,ahhh this is it my mom used to this when i was a kid it was one of those recipes i never got from her this is my first year growing cucumbers and i ve got more than i can handle i this salad according to the and this is it takes me back for sure so much,253
463981,2000313809,5,this is the real deal love love love it you for sharing,55
111514,553318,5,this tastes exactly like my mom used to she only said it s when we asked her how she got her chicken to taste so sadly she died before she revealed her secret but now i know you so much kimd,190
129040,1801549169,5,these were yummo i used 1 2 tsp vanilla and 1 2 tsp caramel extract oh my goodness heaven,89
135916,1788170,5,i have used many different types of banana bread recipes and they are all pretty much the same this one however with the one addition of pudding is wonderful it is so soft and has a flavor this is now my absolute favorite,221
239027,1178802,5,used only whole wheat flour for my muffins substituted the oil for my latest miracle ingredient plain non fat greek yogurt 1 cup of yogurt instead of the oil applesauce combo less calories less sugar and mega protein i used only 1 2 cup sugar i will try adding an extra banana and completely omitting extra sugar next time i used cranberries so that upped the sweetness also added 1 2 cup ground flax seed and since everyone loves a crunchy topping on their muffin but streusel is sooo not healthy i used kashi golean crunch on top just crushed it a little bit smaller again a little bit of extra protein baked 25 minutes rotating pan halfway through 24 muffins,661
483916,1250369,4,this is how i fried bolony i never tried it with the tomato also the onions need to be and grilled to give it a flavor,118
161166,95263,5,these amaretto cookies are the bomb with all of these ingredients how could you go wrong i had forgotten how much i enjoy amaretto and by the time i the cookies i was hoping i had enough of it for the lol,204
18729,60928,5,this is an excellent salad we love blt sandwiches so this salad was a way to enjoy the flavor without all the bread i used 1 teaspoon finely minced garlic in the dressing and left it in a blend of flavors and well worth 5 stars,227
419515,1800289550,5,i this jam three times now it is a really jam i double the to 6 pints everyone that has tasted the jam loves it for sharing making some more to send as christmas gifts,167
94219,167277,5,we love these potatoes i mine with celery salt garlic salt and a dash or two of worshtershire sauce and a dab of butter on top before rolling up the foil of course i use the onion too we have never had a problem of not having flavor like one reviewer said,255
176476,1220228,5,by the sound of this i thought it was going to be disgusting well i decided to give it a try because i had some chicken breast out thawing in the fridge for tonight s dinner and yet i was craving peanut butter so i tried this out well much to my suprise i loved it i hate mustard and hate mayo but these ingredients were together my boyfriend loved it as well and now he says this is his favorite dish that he absolutely loves,426
90180,1843154,5,i have been looking for this for a long time my grandma used to it for family get togethers and it was my favorite really and just like grams i used truvia instead of sugar to spare the calories,194
39087,1331766,5,so much flavor and so to will be making this again for sure and my boyfriend agrees that this must be put in the keep file this dish exactly as posted only used 1 cup of cream and stirred the cheese in to the sauce at the end to thicken it up a bit more can t wait to have the leftovers today for lunch,302
27401,724593,5,those were the days weren t they when you could go to flagstone s with the family and get a meal at a decent price i had this fruit salad many times and since i it now my kids love it too i it in the summer when i can get bing cherries and pit them myself rather than using the canned which i have never seen in the stores this is so lovely and it was one of my favorite desserts as a child i was always asking my mom and dad to take me there so i could have some it s so funny that you posted the i am so happy for the memories and especially for this memorable denise karen,575
46461,1273226,5,this is my favorite i have also used the ragu double chedder sauce when i don t have velveeta on hand it is but the velveeta is best i also don t use any broth i like to use rotini pasta or spirals so that when you take a bite the cheese explodes in your mouth i am getting hungry just thinking about it,303
52035,271911,5,and looks beautiful on a plater but very rich in taste not something you can eat one after another but very pretty looking,122
58309,616526,4,i baked this for my dad we both loved it i warmed up leftovers the next morning adding raisins and topped it with milk wonderful,128
80289,183756,5,absolutely wonderful right out from the oven it tasted even better than bread pudding i ve had at posh pastisseries i only used one apple because i sliced them thin and it seemed like enough and i used french bread which is sort of sweet in its own way so it really added in sweetness and texture and it s fat free i would most definitely it again,347
355613,194108,5,so i a gluten free version to do this you would use 1 3 cup white rice flour 1 3 cup tapioca flour and then enough potato starch to 3 4 cup along with 2 tsp of xanthan gum in place of the flour a lot memphis this dish always gets rave reviews,242
71732,1365959,5,i a loaf and used the rest of the batter for mini muffins which cooked up in about 15 minutes a very the batter tastes like pumpkin pie,135
47601,248647,5,yum the kids and i had fun making this together and were happy to wake up to a warm breakfast we have tried both the oatmeal and the steel cut oats and enjoy both we also added some craisins with the other ingredients half craisins half raisins and it was delish,262
201697,88276,4,this was much better than i expected i ve only used nutritional yeast as flakes until now and was surprised by how it was in a sauce i used soy milk w a bit of better than bouillon for the base put the sauce on steamed broccoli,227
171427,415019,5,these are the most moist beautiful burgers i have ever had i have already had them twice no onion and mushrooms due to personal taste the sour cream is an excellent idea,169
21284,102602,5,this was it was very moist and the only thing i would change would be to sprinkle some of the cinnamon mixture over the top for sharing this wonderful,150
411043,1848605,2,the bread set up beautifully and the texture was perfect but unfortunately it s tasteless although i added both walnuts and raisins another suggestion is that with so many ingredients they appear in the order in which they re used and maybe it d decrease the prep time a little which no way is 10 minutes,304
52019,2187586,5,i this a few weeks ago and it was really i learned from another chef video that don t stuff them too much or you lose the flavor of the artichoke i did it exactly the same i m making them again tonight because artichokes were on sale and this time i am using a better pan to really lock in the steam the artichoke is jumbo size so i have to cook at least 1 hour 45 and possibly two hours these are very close to the way my sicilian godfather them,446
306955,2002424319,5,i cannot believe i found this again it s sooo standby favorite that s a hit with everyone where are you anmwong did you ever more vegan do you have a vegan cooking blog somewhere,178
38953,885544,5,this is the best the is to follow and the loaf turns out wonderfully lemony the tartness from the glaze is an added bonus if you are truly a lemon lover,152
20086,55850,4,i was trying to use up some blueberries i had in the freezer and gave this a test run it was very and i added about 1 8 cup of cake mix to the blueberries before mixing them in so they wouldn t drop to the bottom of the pan i also had to bake this for almost an hour not the 30 minutes as posted all in all worthy of a repeat,325
225516,448911,4,this was a really quick to everything in the one bowl not much mess and into the oven a wintery dessert would be with a dollop of cream on top next time frogmum,160
27229,109232,4,really with melted chocolate sandwiched between two,51
46267,956571,3,didn t win with my party crowd end of the evening half was still there maybe should have used pepper jack,105
339526,2753957,5,these were so to and came out perfect i found that mixing the almond paste and sugar worked better using my hand than the mixer to work out the clumps and get it to a fine consistency other than that they cooked up perfectly crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside i only got 2 dozen out of the though,307
28315,110946,5,wonderful wonderful wonderful dh didn t think it sounded but couldn t stop raving over the taste i used homemade cinnamon bread and added extra cinnamon to the batter i also sweetened the cream cheese with approx 2 1 2 tblspns of powdered sugar and used raspberry preserves topped everything off w more pwdrd sugar and whipped cream,332
356066,2002890542,4,way to use up some ground lamb was definitely,45
41572,120657,5,you lisa i was so disappointed i can t find these chocolate chips now but everyone including myself say these are the best cookies on this earth and my 3 sons family and husband just know it s my very own sam s club only sells nestle now bummer,244
29478,589777,5,and super to everyone enjoyed the pie we will be making this one again for sharing the,86
103966,1153151,5,this is my go to when i don t know what to myself for dinner i love it,70
54069,103809,3,this was ok but not something i need to try again i did the 1 bacon 1 chicken ratio as suggested by ktdid and glad i did the flavor of the chicken was fine and it was moist but the bacon it too salty and the bottom of the bacon had that uncooked appearance that is unappealing i did extra to freeze and it stores just fine like terri said,338
59633,116469,5,outstanding i used this for our christmas eve dinner and it was well received looking at the review above i didn t realize it was a sandwich worked just on the plate with the rest of the meal,191
318998,1677734,5,fixed this for dinner tonight and it was fantastic hubby told me 3 times how much he liked it followed the and gravy was,120
149540,134613,5,the chicken was moist and tender on the inside but still had a coat on the outside from the frying which everyone loved served with attached mushroom sauce and it was perfect for sharing,186
428897,407844,5,my husband i loved this shrimp salad so and fresh tasting i used the larger amount of old bay and the scallions perfect,119
65096,71531,3,concept but we found it didn t have enough flavour i followed the exactly but we were not pleased by the blandness i will try this one again and add fresh garlic to give it an extra zing,186
30946,651118,5,my family thought this was i don t really like banana cream much but still would give it four stars i rated it as a five because everyone else in my family loved it this was the first cream pie i have and the instructions were really to follow i beat my egg yolks with a hand mixer until they were pretty pale because that is what i have done when i custards in the past i wasn t sure if i was supposed to do this or not or if it any difference in the sure you heat the milk flour and sugar slowly i was getting a little adhd while i was making it so i turned it up and left it alone for a little while oops the sugar burnt and i had to start over it turned out the second time though my pie crust was a little shallow so i only put about 1 1 2 bananas in i think next time i it i would cut the sugar back a little it seemed a little bit too sweet to me but everyone else thought it was fine much,896
42473,75082,3,i found this soup to be quite i would however have given it a higher rating if it were not for the high amount of saturated fat substitute the butter and the cheese for low fat alternatives and this chowder is a winner,218
15397,152208,2,i only used 3 4 of the called for ketchup and water but i still ended up with rather blah pork chops floating in a ketchup soup when i pulled them out of the oven not a keeper in my book,186
321648,703869,5,these were to put together its differenet but next time i think i will fry them for spring pac 2009,99
61474,426803,4,this was fantastic and is really did take 5 minutes i had mine with wilted spinach and mushroom couscous and it was fantastic i did some changes though i added garlic and instead of tabasco all i had was chili garlic hot sauce and i added some fresh cut scallions overall wonderful i never would have thought to mix hot sauce and sherry,336
106335,19051,3,this was really to put together and used a lot of ingredients likely to be on hand my family didn t really care for the sweet edge to the meat which isn t saying it s a bad because it s not i think based on what the previous reviewer submitted it really just depends on the reviewers personal tastes i am glad i tried it it certainly wasn t much effort or expense to put together,379
115870,185160,4,very very a little too spicy for the dd but was excellent for us,64
683,98063,4,flavour although personally i found it really sour at first i added about 3 tbsp sugar and then it was right for me bf liked it a lot too and wants to have it again though he thought i should add yet more sugar he has a pretty big sweet tooth though also i had to cook the sauce for longer than stated which was no big deal it just simmered while i the chicken for the,368
156049,138047,5,this is a superb soup ridiculously and quick and yet so full of flavour dh loved it and had almost the whole lot in one sitting my curry powder was milder than madras and i didn t find the soup spicy enough so i added a couple of teaspoons of sambal oelek don t leave the fresh coriander leaves out at the end they really finish it off and complete the flavour ms bold,368
138877,454174,5,hey i halved it but otherwise followed it exactly it is a little strange looking considering its a pancake but if you don t call it that then it just looks really pretty it tastes although next time i would probably add less butter and i would add a bit of sugar to the so that i could skip the syrup for posting,312
428451,2000674947,5,i am trying to learn to like lentils most recipes with lentils are loaded with curry not a fav of mine although this is high on the spices it is very aromatic and works with the coconut milk i have enjoyed lentils for the very first time,237
55506,5185,4,it couldn t have been simpler to and it was,43
101568,146310,5,i wish i would have taken a before picture but you ll have to picture it we have me my dh grnadma and 2 very small children living here and 2 cats and 2 fish and for the last 2 weeks i have been taking care of a dog and her 7 puppies my poor carpet i did one room and ran out of store bought cleaner i used this in a room with cream colored carpeting and my floor is clean and fresh smelling forget the stuff from the store i m going to use this all the time,458
313543,632730,5,this is off the chain soo the caramel sauce really gives the cobbler a taste it is my go to apple for summer,108
14433,268464,5,never had fresh corn prepared this way everyone loved it and will again for sharing menu 9281,93
461758,1974917,5,its so to and my husband loves it definitely one of our favorites i ve already it a few times and since its basic you can twist it or spice it up anyway you want,161
262793,2001284317,5,was so bookmarking the to it again,34
172730,288618,5,this was a lovely drink i have this a few times now i use about a cup and a half of oj and i also use a frozen banana its just as with a regular banana too for,159
54752,2002329324,5,i followed this exactly it turned out my husband loved it i will definitely this one again,90
18296,177219,5,loved it i added come other spices and ice to it more thick it was sooo can t wait to have it again,99
199394,98867,4,while brussels sprouts are difficult to avoid the tried and true boil them until they re mushy that mimics a canned veggie version this is quite you can keep them as cruncy as you like and it s hard not to say that garlic and or cheese anything taste better,257
27147,2001364427,4,i read the reviews and started with layering sides with bacon and using 5 chicken breasts wrapped 1 can of cream of mushroom soup 1 can cream of celery soup and 1 can of cream of chicken soup and a little extra brown rice all of the seasoning was just a bit almost too salty but otherwise everyone of a family of 7 loved it thx for adding your opinion s it mattered to me,371
59488,129190,4,a change from breading and frying i probably wont this again as it was a little bland but like i said it was a change at least,126

150684,2960812,3,i really wasn 039 t sure how many stars to give this my problem is that even though this claims to be paula dean 039 s it is not the same as the one on paula dean 039 s website http www pauladeen com recipes view2 peach cobbler the ratios are all different yes hers calls for a stick of butter but it also calls for 1 5 cups of flour half as much as the printed here i 039 ve one on her website several times and the only adjustment i is that i use a slotted spoon to transfer the peaches to the batter and don 039 t put in any extra syrup the cake holds up better that way and doesn 039 t get doughy and gummy,610
18895,242448,5,yum yum yum i love it i didn t have all the diced tomatoes so i had to add half a can of stewed tomatoes seemed fine but i don t have the original way to compare it to of course,177

38966,894563,4,first from scratch cake for me i really liked it but it didn t puff up as much as a boxed one would i think i had to take it out a little early because it was starting to brown too much but i liked the way it tasted i used 222188 for the frosting it was,253
56858,65308,5,this was a and a phoenix friendly one to boot not having to turn on the oven is always a plus when its 105 degrees the only thing i did different was to omit the bacon just because i was too lazy to cook it i m sure bacon would only the better,243
54328,1803567927,5,overall when i it again i will sure i can get the largest oysters i can find with small oysters it 039 s to much breading i had a mixture is smaller and large oysters the large oysters were outstanding the only change i would is to add old bay seasoning to the flour mix i will this again for sure,297

19252,119230,5,excellent this was my very first dough pie making experience and it went well i substituted and used fresh squeezed lemon juice,127
109717,1478090,5,the kids and i loved making them and they are really and filling i think next time i ll try applesauce instead of oil and perhaps see what they re like without doing the egg white fluffing any way you look at it though these really are,235
8587,771965,5,i am not when it comes to making pecan pies so when i saw this and how quick it seemed i thought i would to try it out and oh boy this was goooood taste and loved the texture of the dough once its cooked so to cover up with whipped topping on top and serving it like that even alone they taste wonderful,303
100118,124605,5,i m sorry i have never written a review for this i have it numerous times it s the only apple crisp i use i don t like oatmeal in mine and the topping on this is chewy in some spots sound the outside of course and melt in your mouth in others for sharing this mustangmom,270
4330,5988,5,we have had this casserole several times at our church functions and it always goes over big,92
228955,599466,4,i have this twice now and the first time i thought it had way too much horseradish i wasn t sure what kind of horseradish to get so i got the fresh kind in the jar and apparently it has a very strong taste the second time i it i used less than one tablespoon maybe closer to one teaspoon and it turned out much better the sauce is more than enough for one block of cheese too i ended up thowing out what i didn t use for the can t wait until my family tries it this weekend for my early christmas dinner,503
111662,302961,5,i love brussels sprouts but folks you need to try this these are absolutely the best that i have ever had i fixed about 2 25 cups and my dad ate about 4 or 5 little sprouts and i ate the rest i would like to try this with spenda for baking and see if it works that way too,272
12122,601015,1,perhaps this works well for you as a tickler but it isn t as instructional as it could be,89
18462,176200,5,i ve never italian beef before and was so pleased to find a highly rated and for it i too did not cook it overnight started it on low at around 7 a m and it was perfect by dinner i did use the pepperoncini and would sure to include them again in fact i m cooking it right now my family loved it leftovers were just as the flavor was just a bit spicy i used mild peppers which was perfect for us for a,400
153349,1195365,1,not a very rice after an hour was hard and inedible had to keep adding more and more milk in it to even try and eat it will not be making this again,148
86667,26719,4,i had some ground lamb in the freezer and asked what dh what he wanted me to do with it he wanted something curry and indian and this is what i found this was very and not very difficult to i cut down the number of fresh chilis from 5 to 2 which i chopped with my hand chopper and included the seeds in the paste mix and used one fresh chopped chili with the seeds heated in oil instead of the dried this was more than spicy enough i think it would have burnt our mouths out if i used all 10 chilis as called for in the and we really do like spicy but for us 3 chilis was more than enough i also didn t have any asafetida powder so i omitted that and used chopped ginger in the jar instead of fresh i also added about 1 2 cup of chicken broth to the simmering lamb substituted chopped asparagus for the peas and added some leftover chopped red green and yellow peppers in addition to the green onions this had a curry indian taste to it i served it with rice and we shared a bottle of red wine,993
109716,85710,5,simply the best rice ever i changed the preparation however because i increased the servings to 80 people for our family reunion i sauteed the onions in a separate skillet the broth in a pot and then added the sauteed onions i put the rice in the pan of my large electric roaster oven poured the broth over it and stirred the broth into it thoroughly i set the temperature to 350 degrees and baked it for 20 25 minutes it turned out perfect just like the name says you for submitting this wonderful that will feed a crowd by the way i served it with 77031 braised and barbecued chicken thighs the sauce from this was so we used it over the rice even when the chicken was all gone,679
150863,215014,5,yum this was so to i don t think it took me near an hour to the flavor is outstanding and it was to cook and walk away i will be making this again,146
186345,243866,5,wow this was really and i substituted some things like a fresh jalape o pepper for the cayenne pepper because that s what i had on hand and i didn t have coriander or green pepper but it turned out oh yeah i added more rice because it looked too soupy but i might not add as much next time,289
328537,388313,5,i this for a unitarian universalist pot luck supper last night i tripled the everyone loved it i followed suggestions of using veggie broth instead of the vegetable stock powder i use imagine s organic no chicken stock so much better than regular veggie stock i also followed one reviewer s suggestion of adding chopped fresh spinach and tomatoes at the end lastly i served it with greek yogurt on the side fast pretty and i borrowed many of the spices from the host of the party,479
66498,969521,4,i also used the graham cracker crust simply because i hate regular pie crust on any pie it turned out and my hubby loved it and he normally doesn t like pie i took this to thanksgiving dinner my in laws today and everyone who ate it raved about it my mil especially i would definitely this again,295
89722,906760,5,instead of yellow cake mix i used lemon cake mix which added a tangy twist the the flavors i would agree to cut down on the sugar over the blueberries but this was a quick husband and friend at work loved it,207
182177,260764,5,veyr as a oamc dump and thawed in the fridge overnight all day dd grilled them and they tasted and were very moist will definitely again,136
137781,220195,4,from the big book of breakfast 2003 by maryana vollstedt a way to oatmeal special,81
170245,205730,3,for an pumpkin treat very filling i agree that this could have used some milk even just a few tablespoons and i definitely needed more cooking time but i have a very low wattage microwave so that could ve been why i crumbled a few gingersnaps on mine and those added a crunch to an otherwise mashed potato ey texture this will be a keeper for some pumpkin pie cravings,368
10273,2002749006,2,when i them the inside just wouldn t cook i don t know if that s because i am gluten free and using gluten free all purpose flour or what but they just aren t working out the flour works like normal flour i think there is just too much butter i would recommend no more than 1 1 2 tablespoons of butter in the picture i split the pancake in half so you can see the gooey inside yuck,381
47434,85306,5,if you like orange with chocolate i juiced 1 orange and added 2c powdered sugar this a thin glaze that i poured over the cake while it was still warm in the pan prior to removal let it sit for 20 min before removing from pan or longer if time permits this it incredibly moist and added a pronounced orange flavor tastes like a chocolate orange they sell at christmas time,371
257321,756627,4,these were i did bake at 15 mins and they were somewhat umm well done should have remembered my oven runs hot that being said this was a very quick and snack one that i would go to again in a heartbeat,201
175678,753258,4,i have to be honest and say the only reason i am not giving this 5 stars is because i really don t like it but my husband and son love it if i this for them they are in hog heaven must be something about texas men anyway it is a very and well liked by all men at least the ones we have served this too they take this on camping hunting fishing trips and request it often at home,378
118761,1520681,5,what a tool for healthier and faster eggs i cooked the first one for 1 minute and the yolk came out over hard i tried the next one for 50 seconds and it came out over medium i think i will go for 45 seconds for over you,219
18458,2002094335,5,quite and although making this for the first time following some other quot kahlua quot suggestions i used white rum instead of vodka,133
121265,244754,5,this mousse is i this each time with a different flavor of sf jello and with sf vanilla pudding since that is all i had on hand my family loves this,148
30954,162086,5,this is one of those recipes you really wish you could give more than five stars i this with brown sugar instead of white and mmmmmmm was it i would say as much as we love sweet things it has plenty of sugar didn t need more added before or after cooking it came out different than i imagined kind of dry like granola but you can stir in some milk warm it or it turns the oatmeal cold you have to nuke it and it more like regular oatmeal better than regular oatmeal for sure kind of chewy crunchy just like an oatmeal cookie,524
257115,624114,5,this was so i m a new cook and this was my first meatloaf and it came out i only one small adaptation and that was a teaspoon of mayonaise to keep it moist,155
129556,403668,5,i this tonight for 4 adults and a couple kids and it was all gone everyone really enjoyed it i didn t have the smokehouse almonds so i added liquid smoke to the mix and used slivered almonds we are not mustard fans so i started w 1 tbsp but it didn t have that bite so i added the other tbsp and it was i added minced garlic because i don t like green onions i used i tbsp bacon bits per slice of bacon 10 tbsp because i am lazy was in a hurry i will this again for sure update i this again the next night for another dinner w friends i had all the stuff needed an appetizer they loved it as well and it was all gone in no time i added a little lemon juice for zing oh rats i just realized i forgot the dijon but it didn t any difference it was still loved,756
180569,66322,5,for a perfect rice to go with our asian meals i was considering buying a rice cooker but this is enough that i won t be buying one after all,140
283801,2456101,5,ann other company chili cook off winner to the award list for this i chose to use chicken stock instead of bullion and my cheese dip had mild jalapenos in it i also threw in a can of creamed corn it came down to a tie for first place but the other gentleman ate mine and declared me the winner this is so some other competitors threatened to use it themselves next time and many folks asked for this link job,408
119792,269582,1,this didn t work the batter s exterior turned hard but the interior was mush the glaze also this dish sickeningly sweet,119
31717,338384,5,nutritious this with acini pepe and kept it warming a while before we ate it pasta was not soggy used italian sausage because i did not have ground beef it was so this makes a ton of soup so it s for company for this,216
161390,512679,5,just had a luau party and wanted to say the mango rum sauce was excellent i did add 1 2 stick of butter to the sauce to counterbalance the heat i used hababero pepper but just put it in the sauce whole while it s cooking and the heat seaps out no chopping seeding or super hot bites taste often because they are hot i find it easier to control the heat with these and i just keep a jar in my frig i had two parties back to back and 2 batches the sauce ahead and stored in freezer for the second party i was short on time and used tyson frozen fried chicken strips for those who want to try this without the extra effort at least try the sauce with store bought strips bravo rita,678
136853,218388,5,very and to i needed a pie for a pie contest at my local fair i picked this one and won with first prize super to and everyone loved it and are still talking about it so much i my own crust and had to leave the topping off due to the contest being held outside in the heat but can t wait to try it again and with the topping a must try 5 stars,343
248837,1052108,5,this is a marinade for pork and beef my family actually marinades venison steaks with it also which turn out fantastic,118
415792,122087,4,i had something similar to this at a very high end restaurant and have been trying to recreate it since i have this many times now and gave it 4 stars because it was very soggy as is i use aguave instead of honey and cut the dressing in half or less 1 4 cup even this can omit much less oil too in my taste i keep the amount of cilantro plentiful and add nuts and craisens those two ingredients really it,404
471044,2002575602,5,i seriously have no idea why this is so but it s now a go to when i want to keep minimal ingredients for lunch at work and i m constantly craving it otherwise,158
56242,180192,4,i halved the it turned out fluffy not wet i didn t fool anyone though it s definately brown rice i will probably it again,121
9351,1002265,4,bread but not the best i ve ever had first impressions were that i wished i d added another banana this is a pretty moist bread though i think i expected more from the sour cream i used 3 4c sugar and it was sweet enough,220
35594,597669,5,this is my go to soup i am doing my best to eat healthier and i find that if i a double batch of this it feeds me for lunch and dinner for over a week it would nbe needless to say i don t the cheese toast i love the combination of flavors and have shared this with friends and neighbors alike i have also sent the link to friends that have heard me rave about it for posting this,379
23883,253935,5,acually i had this before i also got it from a card but i lost it i was thrilled to find it here you so much for posting it it s the best cheesecake i ve ever had,162
81494,750386,5,this was a perfect chili for a rainy day we had it with corn bread muffins and it was a done deal so the cinnamon adds a fresh new taste to chili,145
17964,9590,5,this is one of our family s favorite desserts and this sure didn t disappoint definitely worth getting the processor out for i will be making this one all summer long,166
46764,403281,4,i didn t have any chili sauce so that was omitted i added 2 t of red pepper flakes to give it some zip it was a little sweet for our tastes but with small tweeks was very,170
301678,1700488,5,i only 1 3 the and adjusted quantities as such i also used cream because i had some going to waste wow i have been looking for a creamed corn that uses what most people have on hand frozen corn the recipes with corn on the cob is for the 2 3 months of the year that you can get those in the store but this is perfect year round,327
9270,314498,5,i didn t change a thing my first time making homemade applesauce and it tastes so much better than the store bought stuff i used honeycrisp apples which imparted just enough tang,178
75641,953648,4,very got this from an old wisconsin gas cookbook from the 50 s decided to give them a whirl and glad i did,106
79715,450933,4,i used this at a party this weekend and everyone liked it i ll be using this again for sure,91
14499,101424,5,i found the to be very to follow and the results blew us away i shared slices with friends and after tasting it demanded the immediately eats,141
375021,313120,5,soup i also substitued the meatballs with the browned ground meat,65
13630,292181,5,yum the kids loved it,21
19252,788414,5,was perfect with best ever pumpkin pie 28758 full for deep dish and cut away excess crust put the dough disc in the fridge the night before and rolled the next morning so,170
280408,337017,4,very they were a little crumbly but still tasted and satisfied my coconut craving maybe if i compact them more into balls next time it will work better also i noticed that it s not specified how much you should beat the egg whites i went to soft peaks but not sure,264
97514,55943,5,the butter sauce was fabulous i added a little bit of garlic while it was simmering dh loved it on poached chicken breat and rosemary thyme roast potatoes,154
181057,344149,5,this is soooo though the taste would never give that away what a compliment to a fine ahi steak i prepared this for my parents who are quite set in their non fish eating ways and even they loved it hope you do too cheers,220
101319,278152,5,this salad is so that i quadrupled the ingredients for the vinaigrette and keep it in a jar in the fridge then when i go shopping all i need are the ingredients for the salad and i m ready to go,194
27356,40560,5,kim d just want you to know i finally had the opportunity to try your oooohhh lala it was so i will prepare this for a big dinner i will be serving at the senior center here you so much and keep it up rose,205
76874,176740,4,taste was very but the coating was clumpy despite cooking as directed i was expecting a more smooth coating would again but experiment to get smoother coating,158
97496,1848805,5,these are soft chewy and the best thing is that the ingredients were things i always keep in my kitchen my 3 year old was able to help too with rolling the balls in the sugar cinnamon,183
59363,94168,5,these are excellent i was skeptical about the chilies but the combination of everything together was my whole family and boyfriend loved them i think i will be making them as snacks more often i added twice the amount of garlic and cheese will definitely do again,263
364159,427781,2,not bad but i would not call it fruity that description makes me think of a more tropical beverage,98
113858,2574795,5,similar to lasagna i 039 ve for years spinach or kale is a natural addition and adds nutrition adding diced tomatoes to the sauce gives a texture i suggest adding chopped mushrooms and green pepper to the sauce vary things by using ground beef or your favorite italian sausage or a mix rather than adding water i quickly rinse the noodles in cold water as i assemble the lasagna provides plenty of liquid for the pasta my major change is to use more cheese than the calls for both in the filling and on top after removing the foil i put at least a cup of mozzarella and a more generous amount of parmesan or italian blend on top variation that takes more work is to cook lasagna and then roll the cheese filling inside place in baking dish pour sauce over and bake as above tastes the same but the presentation is a bit different,829
55564,318139,5,works fine i m very happy because you can t find this in france and now i can my own bisquick mix p you i used it to some big waffles with my krups waffle maker and it was perfect,179

162736,460910,5,just if you have any flavored salt even better i used a chardonnay oak course salt,82
280175,174722,5,this is just what i was looking for also i passed up several recipes that had a lot of short cuts such as boxed stock etc i felt a cold coming on and wanted real chicken soup this hit the spot i used rice instead of noodles for chicken rice soup fantastic,255
44232,331817,5,this is a i used tomatoes and basil from my garden and it was really i took it to a friend s house for potluck so i just served it in a bowl with the toast on the side for people to serve themselves everyone loved it,216
287365,103849,5,loved this i don t care for raw onions so used garlic chives from my herb garden i also added a dash of garlic powder didn t notice the garlic flavor and next time would use a little more cayenne pepper served with lime cilantro brown rice,239
181870,211577,5,mmm this was just the type of caramel popcorn i was craving i used 10 cups of popcorn next time i think i ll use between 12 and 15 it makes a very sticky caramel corn with only 10 cups 12 09 this again with about 14 cups of popcorn and it was perfect just sticky enough to popcorn balls with i should mention i used hard margarine both times i ve this,351
259654,165528,5,i was looking for a that was quick and to give my neighbors for christmas i had leftover butterscotch chips i don t particularly like them though i love peanut butter i used chunky so i this without the brown sugar be careful how many cookies you give away these things are addictive the best the very best peanut butter cookies i ve ever tasted very moist very flavorful and i will do them again,396
132932,2002816573,5,this is a from the ball complete book of home preserving its a,62
16805,45139,5,this is an i went home for lunch and threw it all together in less than 20 minutes and by the time i returned home from work my house smelled wonderful and oh how sweet it is to have dinner ready and waiting for me i did however only use 1 1 2 onions instead of 3 i also added a can of stewed tomatoes and a small can of tomato sauce i didn t have any tomato soup either way it was and my entire family loved it even my son who complains about anything w onions in it you for posting we will definitely be using this over and over again this winter,548
131300,422609,4,this was very consistency using 1 3 cup water 1 2 cup would be too runny as was when we added the veggies the mixture became too runny so we added a bit more flour the finished product was crisp flavorful and we loved it hubby told me to keep this for use with all kinds of foods which is a high compliment coming from him,322

62910,137854,5,loved this savoury sour dough bread instead of the milk water sour cream combo i substituted plain old soured milk same quantity 280ml and when i ran short on chives in went minced leek i loved the look of the green flakes in the bread this calls for only half as much sugar as the last sour dough loaf i so the kids didn t rave about this one as much but it is a quality savoury loaf and there is no reason why i wouldn t this again,433
215114,482241,3,these were ok but the next time i them i will pound the chicken first these just came out a little this for my liking but the breading and seasoning were,153

8699,168612,1,sorry the sauce turned out horribly for me i followed the perfectly and while the consistancy was of real gravy it was bland and flavorless i had to add beef bullion garlic and tons of other tinkerings before it was palatable i loved the meatballs though but the sauce was very bland,283
41418,790231,5,garlicky tender goodness to boot if you like lamb and garlic this is a must,75
3397,2331707,5,they re still hot but my daughter tasted one and voted quot yay quot love it so and can just use up a couple of cukes at a time i don t like onions in my b amp b pickles so i just sprinkled on some dried onion flakes,216

140839,595930,5,i m making this for the second time tonight since my family loves it the meatballs turn out so professional and i never meatballs but now it s so this is to and taste authentic for sharing,188
289771,841981,5,we grew up eating turon and its really a comfort kick it up a notch by putting a slice of flan with the banana before wrapping and frying serve with vanilla ice cream perrrfect,176
182659,611548,5,super our garlic salt was a little too salty the didn t say how much salt i would recommend 1 2 tsp or less we use 1 tsp we rolled 1 3 of them in the garlic 1 3 plain and 1 3 in cinnamon sugar for dessert,204
235760,1801993826,4,but skip the sugar,18
268753,961333,5,i this twice in the last week and it was fast and absolutely both times the first time i used yogurt and put the batter in 12 heart shaped pans for garnish to my donation to a potluck wedding reception the batter was thick the results were moist and i had only one broken heart when i carted them to the wedding this morning i the for breakfast and used powdered buttermilk and 1 2 cup jalepeno juice and 1 2 cup water for the liquid the batter was thinner but equally i was afraid tha the muffins would rise too high if i filled the 12 muffin cups too full so i spread it across 18 cups it doesn t expand too much in the oven i ll use the recommended 12 muffin cups from now on this is a definite keeper in my over flowing file,728
77930,185139,5,wow this is the first zaar that my boyfriend said deserved 5 stars we loved the flavor and built and entire meal around it making a warm potato salad with a mustard vinaigrette and a green salad with some mustard in the dressing the chops turned out very moist with flavor for sharing,284
79412,855476,5,this was very everyone in my family loved it i did add a little more cheese than what the called for this was a amount for 4 people although we were fighting over who got the last of it,185
398822,1787953,4,me and my family enjoyed or another hand liked it,49
471,65768,3,we stuck quite close to the and the 2 of us gave it mixed reviews i thought the flavors were marvelous and would easily award 4 stars the blend of tarragon thyme and rosemary in the breading is sublime it s the first time i ve ever liked anything with tarragon possibly because we used fresh not dried we substituted about half the oil in the vinaigrette with white wine instead and i thought it tasted a bit like commercial salad dressing no idea if that s due to the substitution i thought it might have been brighter if it used fresh squeezed lemon juice instead of rice wine vinegar the horseradish in the breading practically disappears but that s a hazard of cooking horseradish it s always strongest uncooked our big change was that we left our 1 3 lb salmon fillet whole w skin on the back seared both sides but only breaded the skinless side we baked 20 min and it was still cold raw in the middle so then we cut into smaller fillets and broiled about 7 minutes and it was finally done just right my so didn t like the breading there was a lot of it and we caked it on heavy since it was only on one side she said she might prefer a lighter breading something japanese style or only use 1c bread crumbs she d only give this 2 or grudgingly 3 stars probably a we ll experiment with the herbs were wonderful,1314
98092,322091,3,it was to but lacked in complex flavors,39
33467,1801749046,2,i used 4 cans of biscuits not the small ones but 8 to a can too many i took it out of the oven and tried to turn it out but it stuck no mention of coating the pan in the directions and it was a non stick i loved the idea but obviously this didn 039 t work for me it would be helpful to have more specific directions in the to prevent problems for non cooks like me,364
116996,2892151,4,very and will again as directed using regular salt only marinating thin venison steaks for 5 hours husband commented his pleasure with almost every bite for posting,164

294235,362202,5,i this last night for dinner and to save two pans for during the month and i really enjoyed it i did some changes due to what i had on hand and it still turned out i used canned carrots and instead of cooking them with the onions i just poured them in with the corn i also replaced one cup of the beef broth with one cup of port wine for even more flavor the oregano i just added a small pinch since it s not my favorite and i used http www recipezaar com 294395 for the mashed potato topping i froze two of the pans and cooked one and it turned out absolutely delish you for a,577

424933,2000029948,1,try this if you want your fish to have no taste very to but they forgot the flavor,82
19815,465080,5,read so many quiche recipes that i pre baked the pie shell for 8 minutes it wasn t soggy i also used 4 eggs and 1 2 c milk because we get a dozen eggs per day from our hens the quiche tasted pretty net time i ll use a deep dish pie crust though,244
14453,13791,4,to prepare but i will reduce the amount of pepsi and margarine when i it again i also sprinkled garlic powder on the chicken pieces before i poured on the sauce i did it in the oven and it took awhile for the sauce to reduce but the flavour was and the whole family enjoyed,273

11757,1803786474,5,wonderful my husband loved this,31
18688,792594,5,i rated this 5 starts for being a very very and very low risk way to prepare an expensive cut of fish i ve never halibut filets before and after searching though a number of recipes decided on this one what a choice even the thirteen year old who doesn t eat fish loved it changed nothing in the as a side we had one filet left so i tried the mexican ceviche with it and that was a hit as well http www com mexican ceviche 8899 mizznezz,436
225169,981367,4,yum left out the sweet potato as i didn t have one on hand and also left out the nutmeg not my fave i think next time i might also cut out the brown sugar as it was a bit sweet for my taste but nonetheless blended thoroughly and then sent it through a strainer for a smooth consistency hubby thought it was less than desirable but then he is a meat etarian so i wasn t really expecting rave reviews from him lol,411
380725,533326,5,very to i was looking for something to with the ingredients i had on hand i added some chopped peppers i had from the farmers market very and,141

132263,2001514610,4,i immediately regretted my decision to not double check the amount of baking powder this calls for in an attempt not to waste i carried on i substituted melted vegan butter for the vegetable oil and i could not disagree more with the reviews below however i do think the substitution is critical happy sunday morning to me,322
352996,1108588,5,a friend of mine this when we had a baby and my four year old son said this meal is too for me needless to say i ve been making it ever since and,145
50956,284904,5,this exactly as from sicily suggested and it was theresa for the and from sicily for your tip,93
120111,202661,2,yuk hated the flavor of the cream cheese and for some reason this tasted overly salty i could really taste the sweetener too sorry but i didn t like it if i am in the mood for fudge i just melt a lc chocolate bar with a touch of heavy cream and nibble on that it comes out in a fudgy consistency i do appreciate that you have posted this and i am sure others will find it a treat you,383
36768,369597,5,my dad devoured this and asked for more i will this again it can even be dressed up for company and it goes with rice pilaf,123
7594,774187,5,well this was my first attempt at a strudel and family fell overthemselves for more literally there was nothing left i did do a few things different though 1 i peeled the apples and i only used four which about 4 1 2 to 5 cups which seemed about right and i sliced them thin 2 i didn t have lemon zest and didn t want to have to go shopping for one thing so after cutting up the apples i poured lemon juice over them making sure they were coated and let them soak while i got everything else ready and then drained them as best i could before using them and 3 i sprinkled sugar and cinnamon on top of the bread crumbs that were on the top of the studel it added a look and a little extra huts puh my familys word for something extra anyway we loved it smelled wonderful so highly recommended,791
7404,832887,5,and to i didn t have any rum or any time to soak the raisins i just poured a little boiling water on them turned out you for posting,132

177157,316094,5,this is the same i ve been using for years from an old meal master posted by mike richichi it won t quite cut it if you re craving beef but it has a taste and is one of the better for you treats i ve found i use a dehydrator so i don t have to flip them over every hour definitely use low sodium soy sauce if you re watching your salt a little chili powder or tabasco can also be added to spice things up,404
31167,1673300,5,for sharing,11
339073,48692,4,mmmmm these are tired of making ordinary rice krispie treats i these tonight and found them very my only complaint is that they seem drier than regular krispie treats and were harder to mix with the cereal as a result i would maybe add a little more butter next time but you,274
176595,155943,4,i had messaged french tart about clarification with lamb quantities with her feedback and instructions my so and i proceeded to this we used 3 lbs of lamb from the leg cut into approximately 3 inch chunks kept the ratios of everything else the same and didn 039 t change anything else lt br gt lt br gt this smelled wonderful cooking over night the most quot difficult quot part is searing the lamb bits in the pan as it is a bit time consuming i think you could skip this step but it adds a little bit of texture and flavor if you do the searing this is an intensely flavored meal with tender falling apart lamb this is perfect served over plain white rice and with a crisp side salad i am echoing other reviews and think the anchovies although i love anchovies could be scaled back a teeny bit regardless this is a keeper,823
17051,1127455,5,lennie this is absolutely brilliant i ve it a few times now since i ve been in the uk i haven t been able to find lawry s seasoned salt in any of the stores and have been searching for a close to it i also added celery salt and will consider doubling the paprika next time i honestly would not have guessed it wasn t lawry s again,330

15242,1380834,5,i 039 ve only had cracker barrel 039 s cheesy hash browns once and i don 039 t remember the taste so i can 039 t really compare the two but this casserole was i only used 2 tb butter 1 cup sour cream and followed the exactly the rest of the way it was not greasy at all i also stirred halfway through cooking time added extra cheese on top the last 20 min and then broiled about 5 more min after cooking time for crunch my family devoured it,441
48014,102937,5,it deserves 5 stars just for the simplicity of preparation it is a wonderful comfort i just it for dinner because it s supposed to drop down to 30 degrees tonight it was 80 degrees yesterday even though it s far from being gourmet the wild rice is a definite plus,263
59462,943857,2,decent on it s own tasted nothing like auntie anne s pretzels not worth the effort,82
441519,2282582,5,the cookie is pretty even before adding the jam i these with some fig preserves and a black forest cherry jam this will be a way for me to clear out all my near empty jars of jam from my fridge yay,197
361631,806846,4,this was ok i used 4 tb of lemon juice and i feel that the 4 oz of goat cheese was way too much for the serving amount in all fairness it was my first time trying goat cheese and it was a bit too tangy for me hubby loved this dish though,237

203903,593431,5,for lamb chops on the grill we loved the combination of flavors in the marinade my chops were a little on the thick side about 1 and i cooked them about 8 mins on each side and they came out a little pink in the middle the key to them being perfect is to sure you check them often so they don t get too well done as they will burn if left unattended i marinated for about 6 hrs and the flavors were infused nicely in the meat,425
114584,1355412,5,i have been making recipes from this book since the 70 s when my brother bought mr price s house from him a copy of the book was left behind this rice is one of my most loved side dishes with an marriage of flavors i generally use 1 4 cup butter but either way it s sensational i serve it without the mussels regularly,318

37889,767712,5,i would like to consider myself a seasoned baker and i was really weary about this much cinnamon and this much nutmeg but it turned out i used pecans since they are my favorite they are very and very very,204
153642,2373440,5,so they are quick and to put together i did 3 small changes i used just 1 2 cup of sugar and canola oil instead of the butter i also added one tsp of cinnamon i 039 ve them twice now and will use this from now on husband loves them,231
470163,1803390340,5,i really liked these buns especially because they were and took less than two hours i liked the texture and the color after they came out of the oven with the leftover buns we ate them the next morning for breakfast with jelly just as the next day you can toast them on a griddle if you like that texture,304

110421,989548,5,these were okay here were my changes i used 2 cups whole wheat flour 1 cup sunflower seeds instead of the coconut and brown sugar instead of white i also only used 1 2 cup of oil and 1 4 cup of unsweetened applesauce i think next time i will cut back the oil even more as the applesauce worked also added some raisins used a 9x13 pan and cooked at 350 for 15 minutes they were thick and chewy and held together perfect,418

124717,378488,5,we loved this i used the orange sugar free jello and used fat free cool whip with 1 low fat cottage cheese and the rest of the as written this is 3 points per serving if you are counting points the nutrition facts shown are for the regular cool whip for this we will it again using different jello flavors,305

19300,196369,5,this is one of those once in a lifetime recipes that you ll want to keep in your secret 3 x 5 for eternity i followed the exactly with one very minor exception i used one box of instant french vanilla pudding and a second box of regular instant vanilla which worked beautifully i think another key to my success to this was that i lightly greased my 9 x 13 casserole dish with crisco the puff pastry came up evenly on the sides and did not stick anywhere i drizzled chocolate fudge topping in a diamond pattern to top the dish and i got more immediate requests demands and bodily threats actually for this moreso than any other that i have ever served i lied like the dickens and told everybody how difficult the was just so that they would appreciate my super human culinary skills to an appropriate level heh heh heh anyway the truth is this is a really if you follow the directions precisely 30 minutes baking time was fine in my oven for the puff pastry i can tell you for certain that this has become my numero uno covered dish for all future dessert requests wow what a superb dessert you so much 3boysmama for posting it pat the old bone man,1148

45896,2001822887,5,this turned out so well it was a hit with the entire family i used a precooked uncut bone in ham so i had to slice it myself before starting the ham was 11 6 lbs so i doubled the i also added a bit of ground cloves and allspice to the glaze i lowered the baking temp to 275 for the first hour and a half and then upped it to 325 fo the last hour i also sprinkled some extra brown sugar on the outside before i carmelized it with a butane torch i can t wait to this again,470
438268,678456,5,excellent followed and they turned out really next time i might change up the veggies maybe add ham or turkey who knows might try with only egg whites to keep it even healthier,176
67570,2001014158,1,not close to the olives are too strong in this and it overpowers the eggplant garlic and tahini the dip was darkened by the olives my suggestion find another it couldn t get worse sorry whoever wrote the,203
15411,141140,4,fun quick and also added vanilla and used 1 2 splenda and 1 2 sugar couldn t tell the difference very peanut buttery,116

135802,1352632,5,i cut the in half to fit into my spray bottle added a dab of dawn and a few drops of lemon oil works except for on my mirrors but i think that was because of the lemon oil love it,179
34382,116607,5,i substituted russet potatoes used freshly grated parmesan and then mashed in a few minced leaves of fresh sage from the garden the sage and parmesan together elevated our weekday dinner to gourmet will definitely try with the red potatoes next time,249
190521,523426,5,this was excellent i ve other versions but this was the best i followed the as stated and the entire family enjoyed it for a wonderful,134
98724,961653,5,i m 57 years old and have had them every summer since i was old enough to eat yum must have with fresh tomatoes from the garden any ones garden no you can t gain weight on them yes you will think of them in the deepest cold of winter even then they will put a smile on your face and you feel as if the sun has come out,318
428657,2001212737,5,just this it was outstanding i had chunks of crab so substituted it for the lobster everyone loved it,101
70165,976444,5,we just finished eating this fabulous pizza my husband told me to pizza from this from now on my 11 year old daughter loved it too better than the regular crust pizza she said you for the it s a winner,201
188279,364235,4,very you can get the for the weck on the internet next time with the real thing the roll that is what makes it,110
211564,370315,4,it tasted very i used fresh coconut and it really brought out the coconut flavor the frsting wasn t that you could taste the confectioners sugar more than anything else,168
287259,145626,5,i too grew up eating this i thought it was a healthy snack and i m glad to see others say the same my mother always thought it was fattening,140
391880,2096720,4,overall it is very but is very dry putting a little milk helps,62
13285,253595,5,best turkey burgers ever flavorful and moist not dry like most turkey burgers a in my book i served them on whole wheat buns with tomato cucumber spinach leaves and cucumber dressing fiancee ate them with mayo and ketchup,221
140934,432917,4,this was really dh even liked it i would actually put some of the taco seasoning on the potatoes too will do again,114
108231,561942,5,very i mixed liquids spices and frozen corn to start it boiling i added a can of rinsed black beans and a can of rinsed kidney beans to this mixture i used fresh tomatoes and broiled them along with jalapenos both already chopped on high for about 15 minutes before adding as well i also cooked chicken and fresh veggies separate first in pan before adding to soup after which i let simmer for about 20 minutes 10 star i agree,426
13285,946273,5,my husband and i loved these burgers we are new to using ground turkey and just beginning to accumulate recipes this is definitely a keeper,139
95145,2000394058,5,some people complained of graininess that happens when you stir too much or don 039 t dissolve your sugar for example when you add your butter sugar and evaporated milk to your pan stir it to blend and dissolve while you 039 re bringing it to a boil once it starts to boil remove your spoon set your timer and don 039 t touch for 5 minutes sure your temperature is sufficient to keep it boiling but not so hot that it burns remove it from the heat immediately when your timer goes off and then spread it stirring it while it 039 s boiling will cause it to be grainy,565
58309,1114028,5,i have been making this at least once a week for about a year i just never got around to reviewing it its a real keeper but you definitely need to doctor it up i usually add a diced apple 1 1 2 tsp cinnamon 1 2 tsp nutmeg 1 2 cup nuts and 1 2 cup dried cranberries if i have extra ripe bananas i may mash two and using cinnamon and walnuts i rarely refrigerate before baking since i usually bake it up at night and cut into bars for a healthy breakfast on the go it packs up well and makes a travel snack too,508
46262,136645,5,i two over 20 pound turkies this year for thanksgiving and this was perfection even tho the birds were so large they still came out moist and juicy and oh so beautiful i sure my bird was uncovered for the last hour of cooking at 350 everyone had thought that they were the prettiest birds they had ever seen you uncle bill you our holiday this year big hugs,357
68084,117396,4,the taste was marvelous the only change i will next time is to lightly dust the chicken with flour before placing in the pan so it will thicken the juice from the chicken maybe it was extra juicy because i only had 1 milk the cherry tomatoes were a surprise to the mouth and enhanced the flavor of the cheese mixture one marie,326
17586,1524034,1,i don t like to be the negative one here but this was awful both my husband and i thought it was just about the worst meal i have ever i followed all directions to a t we love enchiladas and mexican i will never this again,222
45809,265295,4,this is fairly to i it with 1 lb of chicken used the extra sauce as gravy for the rice light soy sauce helped reduce the sodium i doubled the ginger crushed red pepper which gave it a spicy kick that was well complimented by the ginger adding a teaspoon of starch will help cut the simmering time in half,304
25967,1327483,5,an absolutely salad just the right amount of dressing to bind all the ingredients you for sharing this with us,110
132194,272758,5,love these cookies i have been making them for years i have an easier version that i just entered under the same name with only 5 ingredients just waiting for an approval,170
482623,1940011,1,i tried these tonight thinking i had a chicken wing i don 039 t know how the other reviewers could score this with 5 stars it is horrible one of the worst chicken wing recipes i 039 ve tasted i had to broil them twice as long as the calls for and the pan was on the highest rack i 039 m still looking for the chicken wing from leanne chin 039 s restaurant the best wings i 039 ve tasted,386
165454,264600,5,this dessert comes with my highest recommendation even though i a mistake i forgot to bake the shortbread layer until i had already added the raspberry jam and chocolate it was wonderful i can only imagine how it will be when i it correctly i think it is best served hot out of the oven under a scoop of vanilla ice cream although it is however it is eaten,356
43891,131807,5,this was a and so for posting,29
29413,701083,5,the taste of these delectable treats is outstanding and they are sooo to they were the first to go of many other treats at my party i drizzled them with white chocolate and they looked beautiful displayed on a pretty plate i a second batch the day after my party for my family to have all to themselves i ll definitely be making these again and again,350
38298,240692,5,this was soooooo the whole family loved it i did increase the amount of potatoes and used real bacon instead of bacon bits,122
180805,2147919,5,these cookies reminded my son of our new york eating ventures i 8 cookies and weighed each to be 57 g and they were all uniform in size i doubled the icing but it was a bit too much next time i would 1 5 the icing and only add clear vanilla to the white icing portion baking on the middle rack is critical so the bottoms don 039 t get too dark the first cookie was tricky to ice but i learnt to ice half let it set and ice the other half these were cookies and our keeper list,476
19677,2000060833,4,to and wonderful to eat this is very rich and heaven only knows how many calories but it is so pie to take to a potluck as it isn 039 t messy and fragile have served both with and without ice cream or whipped cream we prefer it without either it is so rich that a topping is almost overload,290
68293,445250,5,i just it last night it was its different than another i have i think i like this better,88
33752,829048,5,this french onion soup was and i got rave reviews i used 3 parts beef broth and one part beef stock and it really upped the flavor sure to splurge and get a quality cheese i used a blend of gruyere and mozzerella and it was for a,229

426940,328048,5,yum it s not so hard to put together you just have to willing to have a few pots on the stove at the same time i served this at a luncheon and everyone enjoyed it for the,170
199065,420233,5,i was looking for a light crisp butter cookie and these did the job i actually rolled the dough into a log chilled and sliced it thin it was a lazy way to get excellent cookies my old used granulated rather than powdered sugar but i really liked the powdered sugar version,272
170887,254805,5,this was a light dinner very to prepare and very fresh tasting my whole family loved this and i will be making it again i didn t have any rosemary so i used basil instead and some whole button mushrooms instead of portabellos i also sliced the chicken breasts into long strips before marinating for extra flavor,311
56,2300689,5,holy cow this was so this was the first pie i have ever was surprised how it was i will be making this again very soon,118
137725,1330681,5,i adapted this a bit using low fat creamy pb a heaping tbsp of cocoa and a heaping tbsp of flax seed meal they are very rich and i love that they are gluten free and my kids are devouring them as i type extremely filling desert like and yet quite healthy a definite winner,272
31901,2000555664,5,i bake very rarely yet this was to understand and turned out perfectly my family loved it so much that i hardly got even a bite of it the breading crust was my dad said it was a lot different and a whole lot better than other cobblers he has had you for sharing this,266
137530,520701,5,mmmmm making this lead me to making the ras el hanout and preserved lemons since i still have a while to go until the lemons are done i the tagine without and it was i m definitely making it again when the lemons are ready for sharing,234
126623,88732,5,loved this dish probably should have waited until it was 20 below zero to it but it was even in 90 degree heat i used 2 velveeta and turkey sausage with no compromise to taste or texture the hardest part was scrubbing and boiling the potatos i might consider adding a little spinach or kale next time please try this you won t be disappointed,342
63666,128208,5,i don t think you need another 5 stars but i wanted to tell anyone else living in asia hong kong that this method of cleaning your washer really works the humidity here is so high i had given up thinking i could get rid of that rotten garbage smell from my machine after one aoolication it s gone a life saver and nose btw i used it just as directed,349
202957,349760,5,what a wonderful i this before a special dinner tonight it was a real hit and we did not have leftovers i will be making this again and again for sharing,153
169007,155798,5,this is very similar to the my mother always used so i it up the other day for my family my boys love it and i much prefer it to the other hedgehog versions that use condensed milk,180
47256,1096475,5,my family absolutely loved this casserole and i loved having the for freezing format to use with leftover thanksgiving turkey both casseroles turned out very creamy and well seasoned i did several substitutions 1 bowtie pasta instead of linguine at the request of my husband he doesn t like the texture of linguine in a casserole 2 cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom due to my mushroom allergy 3 chopped onions instead of sliced mushrooms again due to my allergy i froze these with the cooking instuctions on a post it note in between the foil and the plastic wrap super to cook on a busy evening after work,623
29127,290985,5,very bread i used rhubarb that i froze last year i live at a high altitude so automatically cook everything at 25 degrees higher temperature this cooked in 45 minutes i substituted z trim for half the oil and could not tell any difference in taste or texture,258
105583,1449107,5,very and i forgot to line the baking pan with foil and as i write this the pan is still soaking in my kitchen sink if you this don t forget this step that will save you some aggravation,185
103966,892911,5,very did not even feel like i was on the southbeach diet my dad couldn t believe it was diet,92
124505,47723,4,we really liked this i did add about a 1 4 c of milk which i think really helped along with some frozen peas to a complete meal i also kicked the heat up to 325 degrees for about 20 minutes to melt the velveeta i will definitely this one again,243
466453,2000724983,5,oh my goodness so,17

30154,76559,3,i think i was let down by my choice of beef broth i it using stock cubes instead of true broth the juices of this just didn t taste authentic the meat was lovely and tender though,179
2886,2002452441,5,wow this truly is the best banana bread i have ever had and baked we will be keeping this forever why go anywhere else only add was 1 2 tsp of cinnamon it was perfect and it was gone in minutes,193
128956,1802452723,5,not sure why your reads beef broth is best i find chicken broth and vegetable broth just as lt br gt to it even simpler use canned sliced carrots canned zuchinni agreed it is not fresh vegetables but it will do in a pinch,221
234169,2196111,5,very everyone in my family ate it up the only problem they found with it was it smelled so everyone wanted to eat an hour before it was actually ready lol,154
30167,511125,4,pretty spicy i it in the microwave with 1 cup long grain rice and 2 cups water and without the corn cook the rice and water covered for 6 minutes on high and 5 minutes on 50 power add tomato sauce and seasonings cook 10 minutes on 50 power let rest covered about 2 minutes stir and serve,287
138080,1062604,5,i substituted no fat greek style yogurt for the sour cream i also added chopped italian parsley along with the onions and the parmesan the basic cooking method works and makes for a very fish,191
43537,388907,4,i didn t have time to cut up a chuck roast so i used 2 parts ground beef and 1 part sausage bob evans original i used beer in place of the water and halved the amount of cayenne i tasted it after it had simmered and it was spicy it also wasn t the kind of chili i m used to i ve always a very tomato based chili so i panicked because i was having company for dinner i added two large cans of tomato puree and 1 large can of tomato paste threw in a can of dark red kidney beans and added more garlic powder the chili turned out really i probably shouldn t even be rating this because i changed it so much but the gave me a really base for some really chili,655
102483,224930,5,i have these only instead of marshmallows i used peanuts they are addictive,75
155021,1739428,5,my husband said these are the best he s ever eaten i ve them 3 times in the last couple weeks i broil them 10 minutes a side on the 2nd oven rack and hubby says they are perfect and to never change a thing i don t like wings but i love that these are so and too,261
305875,1234395,5,we all loved this salad dressing on our greek salads i it and let it sit in the fridge for about 6 hours and it was really flavorful the family all ate it and said how it was so it will be again,194
93249,198228,5,this was incredibly i used an indoor grill and grilled it i loved it for a treat,80
45071,153866,4,i didn t have a pie crust but the combination of ingredients intrigued me so i mashed up together all the ingredients except the pie crust and put into a dish and in the oven it was very could be eaten as is or used for the base of a sweet potato casserole with the pecan topping on top yum,290
57716,467659,5,i these all the time everyone who has tried them has loved them my favorite is chocolate cake chocolate icing and dark chocolate candy melts to cover my husband prefers yellow cake chocolate icing and white candy melts i have also this with a family size brownie mix with results for christmas i a chocolate cake and added peppermint extract and decorated with crushed candy canes huge hit for my daughters valentine s party i red velvet cake cream cheese icing and white candy melts with pink candy melt drizzle perfect size for little hands i always use the wilton candy melts to coat but i am looking into a bit higher quality chocolate as i have had some quality issues this year i also always freeze chill the balls again before dipping it helps the chocolate covering go a bit further and the balls stay together well for dipping one other note don t use the whipped icing as it may the inside a bit too gooey,915
19859,2299643,5,sooo i this for me and my husband during the week served with rice and broccoli that weekend i talked my mom into making it and she loved it too she already passed the on to my grandma a definite keeper,202
78194,2352980,5,oh my goodness these were the only thing i did differently was cut the amount of cayenne pepper in half and omit the jalapenos keeping the jalapeno juice this is only because i have pretty much no tolerance to spicyness everything else i kept the same and it turned out perfect you for this wonderful oh and much better than taco bell s,336
10155,221530,5,this was my first try at cooking ribs and i am so glad i found this very and absolutely tender juicy and an absolutely must try,127
97244,377614,4,this was a very soup to and the kasha adds a unique earthy taste to it will definitely again,92

62994,169750,5,these were simply my husband is a lemon lover hat s off to the chef oh that s me for the wonderful i m not a lemon lover but i really enjoy them,144
25396,1352950,4,this for some guests and got reviews my mango was under ripe so it didn t have a strong mango flavour otherwise it was just as the next day when the suggests using a large pot use it this yields a large amount the dish is soupy but that is actually authentic in thai cuisine,274
29772,963934,5,this is super dh said he could eat the entire pan i used 1 large fresh chili instead of the canned greek yogurt in place of the sour cream and an unidentifiable cheese that had been hardening in the frig voila it was wonderful it 039 s so to ahead that i 039 m going to double it for a big lunch crowd coming over this week cookkelly,333
41672,2002447494,5,it s everything i ve been craving i once bought a bottle of bleu cheese dressing from the store and it was sweet yuck since a couple reviews said it tasted too much like mayo and i m not really a fan of it anyway i used more like a 1 4 cup and up the difference with sour cream because it still needs the thickness mayonnaise gives however i hesitated to put in the lemon juice i thinned it out a little bit and added the tang it needed with a tablespoon of buttermilk instead since this only used about half of my 5oz blue cheese crumbles i ll trying adding the lemon next round stuff,585
45753,47335,5,my first foray into candymaking and the came off like i d bought it out of a savannah ga sweets shop inspired me to try my hand at other candy recipes,150

31378,26584,2,this does not have the love and attention i am use to at recipezarr i was looking for a use for shallots and i like pasta so i choose this but there were problems for one thing three shallots get lost in a pound of pasta and i would suggest cutting pasta to lb also and perhaps most important though perhaps more personal is i found the half and half overpowered the subtlety of the shallots mechanically the has problems why 8fl oz why not a cup or as chico marx said viaduct i don t know why not a goat the half and half curdles so be prepared to stir and stir i would suggest taking the pan off the heat before pouring in the half and half indeed mine did not thicken so i added a half tb of flour i mixed it with a little water first and would suggest you do that,767
66738,1737192,5,this was a success with friends added some pecans because they were there it 2 fullsize or 4 mine loaves,104
58121,57437,5,these were outstanding i loved them and am sure to again the kids thought they even looked really cool i microwave for a few minutes to speed up the process and then baked for a half hour before putting on the cheese the butter herbs and cheese put this over the top i loved it with the crispy edges,299

115153,146187,5,until now i hated cauliflower no matter how it was prepared i am making this agsain for dinner tonight can hardly wait we found though that on hour was too long to bake i used a coated pan so that might have a difference kellymae you have a caluiflower lover out of me you,272
119643,2593203,5,this was really i used turkey instead of beef i served it with low sugar ketchup and mustard and a green salad for this,119
5108,1271713,3,the duck turned out i marinated it for an hour but i wish the flavor was a bit stronger thou,92

326745,2001529464,5,excellent i love amish and this really hit the spot for people wanting to gravy with the seasoned flour i recommend you reserve 1 4 cup of the seasoned flour prior to dipping the raw chicken it s always better to be safe than risk your family s health,251
76053,105125,5,it did taste like a chicken pot pie only w o the crust very so i didn t have the fried onions so i used bread crumbs on top you for something new,145
135687,302961,5,never had mustard in my deviled eggs but these were just just like all your recipes are i am going to start claiming your recipes as my own since i them often again for being such a wonderful cook and person,207
33752,218828,5,i ve several recipes and by far this was the best and some of the others were laborsome goes to prove that can beat fancy when it comes to french onion soup,156
85629,268464,5,i know why this recipes has so many positive ratings these were really planning on making again i did slice my potatoes earlier in the day and chilled in ice water i think it helped the potatoes from getting too soft when baking for sharing,240
92647,88103,5,them this morning used melted butter instead of margarine they were fluffy and very will use this again,103
181909,786065,5,excellent little sammy especially with my homegrown tomato,58
93278,449302,5,i really liked the cream cheese in this form of lasagna my husband seems to think that it needs another layer of noodles on the top but i thought the was wonderful as is,169
343110,2000278368,3,this is a copy off of someone else on the internet luckily i thought 1 tsp of pepper was too much and only put in 1 2tsp and that was plenty still needed a bit more salt and was overall merely ok,195
24243,107953,5,oh my gawd i have never mushroom soup before but i can honestly say it s the best i ve ever tasted my boyfriend agrees i used 2 bay leaves but other than that followed the to the letter this will be a regular at my house for the,228
465903,1803007006,5,i it twice in a week and then shared it with my family who also loved it will definitely be making this often,109
104150,2001327922,5,this casserole is but if you re like me and feel the need to follow recipes to the letter you re going to have trouble with the pan size it says to use a 1 quart baking dish but just the can of yams alone is 1 25 quarts i used a 1 5 quart dish and it was just big enough 2 quarts would probably work even better otherwise as is,327
111674,214394,4,yummm these cokkies were sooo i them over the weekend with my little nephew neice and they came out sooo and we topped them off with sprinkles,142
34943,99872,4,very for using my christmas ham leftovers i had some mushrooms i had to use up too and added those in to me the mustard taste was a little strong so may use less next time,171
56663,369989,5,what a way to use garden vegetables in the late summer this a chowder full of veggies i used fresh tomatoes peeled and seeded and halved the cheese i love the added parsley it just adds to the fresh flavour of this soup mmm,223
108452,205730,4,i never would have thought of the pudding jello combo it was very a little gelatinous for me i expected something a little creamier so maybe next time i will try it with a small jello instead of a large one definitely a keeper though way to enjoy strawberries,259
65641,227024,5,wow this is i grilled pizzas on the bbq tonight and used this sauce on trader joe s pizza dough topped with mozzarella this enough sauce for 3 4 regular size pizzas or 6 8 individual size pizzas depending on how much sauce you like so much kittencal,249
67256,6993094,3,americans i would have given this a greater review if it was clear that the frosting called for super fine sugar or finely blended granulated sugar icing sugar is a european term and is often reserved for what americans call confectioner 039 s sugar but that sugar is cut with cornstarch and when used in the amount it creates an entirely different consistency in the frosting you need to almost double the amount of sugar in the frosting if you use confectioner 039 s sugar best to add superfine or blended granulated sugar if you want a better result i learned this lesson the hard way when i a two layer cake and all of the icing puddled at the bottom of the cake it 039 s just not a ratio to the fats in the butter and cream cheese,735
48401,519838,5,how do you flan even better is it even possible yes you add chocolate cake to it very,85
175013,381312,5,my husband is from north carolina and misses the barbecue terribly this is the best barbecue he has ever had even better than home so much do you happen to have a for the hushpuppies,182
122954,2000421429,5,i love this i don 039 t use the popcorn twists though i have had it with them and this gave me the idea i regular popcorn and follow the directions my popper is a 6 qt one and i 2 of them i get people asking me all the time for my caramel popcorn at christmas and it has become a tradition to give away in fact my niece wants me to a bunch for the popcorn bar at her upcoming wedding,383
206958,963024,5,this was lovely i am a huge fan of peanut butter and apple together and this was just what i was craving i used apples i had canned myself instead of fresh because that is what i had on hand it was that way but i also think i would like the fresh for a touch of crispness,271
31342,35251,5,and literally can be a base for any leftover veggies i it once with spinach and broccolli and just it again with muhrooms and asparagus both times sans meat this is a go to for leftover veggies in a healthy fun way,214
218950,193127,5,very i used extra virgin olive oil and added some sesame oil to enhance the sesame flavor it was to our desired tenderness after 5 minutes threw in some minced garlic because we love garlic for posting,201
37821,437237,5,shelli i these last night i will definately again although just a tad bit dry next time i will cover with foil and see if they are a bit more moist for the wonderful,165
73440,2002590446,2,how long to bake mix and 375 degress no cook time posted,56
214305,814478,5,that was really probably 8 apples is too many they did not fit into my baking dish so i ate one fresh i did it without crust and it tasted the only problem is that i it in a baking dish with removable sides so the syrup started dripping through the holes and i had to wrap foil around it probably it was not the smartest choice of a baking dish for the cake without crust for serving we liked it with caramel nut ice cream,422
152136,181781,5,really and lite as a side dish might be a topping for nachos after they are removed from the oven,97
37777,734990,4,my husband loved this and my toddler ate all her veggies without me having to sneak them since dh and dd are dairy free i used soymilk and dairy free butter i did add cubed potato 1 2 of a large baking potato next time i will use dark meat the chicken breast i used got a little too dry also it was too onion y for me so i will reduce the amount of onion and maybe a little more seaonings it was a bit bland for my taste you again,430
137629,96627,2,these were just ok for us even though i cranked the oven up to 375 the breadsticks didn t brown i had to turn the broiler on for that and even then they had kind of a raw taste just didn t work out for us,204
222696,1800110852,4,salad everything in hungarian cooking is supposed to be used though even the water that is extracted from the cukes for purists put the salt on the cukes and use the liquid from the cukes to thin the vinegar that 039 s why it sits for 2 hours but during that time you stir occasionally to be sure the liquid and vinegar are mixing and the flavors mix evenly so purists wouldn 039 t add extra plain water because it dilutes the flavor it is also possible to add finely chopped fresh dill to this and any other cucumber dishes of hungarian origin at least one tablespoon of fresh dill would be used use a generous amount,618
63786,2001776235,5,these fajitas were actually i followed the exactly and the flavour was approved even by my super picky husband i used beef and today will try making them with chicken,166
150769,116009,5,these were for sharing,22
71496,584965,5,this is i love the combination of the veggies feta cheese,57
220417,597538,5,easter would not be easter without a big butter cream egg in our baskets i 2 big ones for my boyfriend and i and then up more of the smaller ones to freeze to give to family members at easter when i give them their easter baskets these freeze really well which makes it possible to lots of different kinds to tempt my families taste buds the kids will love these too,366
110619,271299,5,my husband s favourite dessert used to be chocolate amoretto cheesecake but since trying this he has changed his preferance my children 12 14 hate cheesecake but they cannot get enough of this cake umm so chocolatey and you catfish charlie,239
209764,2000412941,4,very gluten free but i found the taste of baking soda a little too strong perhaps a little less needed for my tastes,116
173691,125349,5,words cannot describe how these rolls are i have been searching for a long time for a cinnamon roll that actually yields those ooey gooey type rolls you can only find at the bakery and this is it for posting thos i ll definitely be using it a lot,246
49393,282929,5,a rather that i ll be sure to save to my sides file i did change the fresh sliced potatoes to the canned variety which also provided the added benefit of a faster cook time i also eliminated the salt and garlic salt as a personal preference and the results were still excellent you for posting this,298
153345,379007,5,this has become a family favorite i have it several times each time with a different sausage i use corn grits because we enjoy the taste and the yellow color makes an attractive dish also added a small can of sliced mushrooms and stir these in with the eggs and milk very to and very to eat,290
54961,26719,4,this was very and gave the meat a tangy taste the first time i it for deer steaks and the second time was for a pork loin roast both times i substituted pure quebec maple syrup nothing beats canadian maple syrup for the honey red wine vinegar instead of plain about 3 heaping tsps of minced garlic we love garlic and i cut the amount of oil considerably i also used alot of ground ginger for a more pungeant taste i ve never been one to measure these things because i find most recipes understate spices for our taste so i always adjust them to personal taste levels as for the soy sauce the as is makes it quite salty tasting so i had to add quite a bit of vinegar and maple syrup to balance it off if you re making the receipe as is and not using my free for all spice additions i would cut the soy sauce by half if you don t like a salty taste i marinated the deer steaks for a few hours and per hubby s request fried them in my teflon electric skillet very but i didn t marinate them long enough when i it for the pork loin roast i put it in a ziploc bag and marinated for about 24 hours shaking the bag often because of the oil separating i glazed some of it over the roast before i put it in the oven and basted several times with the remainder as it was cooking it was so and had a very tangy flavor the garlic chunks baked into the top of the meat wow very this is now my standard marinade because it worked on deer meat and pork so i m sure it will be on steak i think i ll even try it on chicken and substitute white wine vinegar for that keeping the rest of the the same this is a definite keeper,1607
83170,323556,1,i love egg custard and this just didn t do it for me i followed the to the letter the taste and the texture were too fluffy breakfast eggy and not smooth and sweet like i expect from custard the edges were really chewy maybe it would be better baked instead of microwaved,271
51521,41531,5,i hosted a party for a women s league and used a german theme i chose this because it was and used things i had on hand my daughter was very disappointed to find none left when she got home so i another the next day i sprinkled the top with cocoa powder it was very pretty for a wonderful,288
48878,345234,5,i love these taste just like a peanut butter cup,48
234275,472052,5,this rice went wonderfully with the jerk marinated steaks i grilled up the other night i really enjoyed the flavor and subtle sweetness of it i did use the curry powder and added a little fresh chopped poblano chili to the dish to add a level of heat which i enjoy used flat italian parsley instead of coriander leaves aka cilantro will definately again next time maybe i ll have a camera by then,396
25735,153253,4,this was really the mustard tastes in here it could have used a little more pizzazz for me to get a 5 star maybe onion powder or seasoned salt but it was and i served it on rolls for dinner,189
129250,541626,5,like the previous reviewer i used zucchini yellow squash fresh mushrooms onion and included the cayenne pepper it was excellent for sharing your,144
82177,1803644858,4,this is called a shepherd salad in turkey tr ccedil oban salatasi but without ground pepper,91
54858,1376179,4,very i added steamed pureed spinach to the potato so perhaps that affected the texture not so light and fluffy more dense and heavy very to i boiled mine than simmered in a roasted red pepper soup with sauteed garlic and topped with shaved parm yum,248
258279,426000,2,this looks way better in the picture than it did in my crock pot the flavor just isn t there either i m glad other people like it but we don t sorry,148
113280,443146,5,this is the way they prepare corn on the cob here in mexico and it is wonderful i definitely wondered what the lure was in the beginning mayonnaise on corn but have since joined the club we always add much more cayenne and everyone loves it you for the written on this one,272
189150,2000326205,2,this was way too dry i did not like it at all,45
32204,124614,5,i didn t want to share i these for my undergrads i m a ta for their final exam and as a reward for trying so hard all semester but once i got them out of the oven i didn t want to bring them to class they are really really and really really i didn t even follow the directions and they turned out well i just dumped all the first ingredients in one bowl and mixed until even then i added my special mixture of chopped up reeces cups rollos and m ms they were oh and i doubled the and had to bake in my 9 by 13 dish for 32 minutes i used tinfoil for such a,555
127341,40587,5,i this last night using a full sized whole wheat boboli pizza crust and doubling the quantities of the toppings i used fresh basil and a bit of fresh tarragon too i also used more arugula then the called for exact measurements aren t really important it makes an and supper,273
87673,678263,4,it last christmas it is amazingly but i followed directions exactly mine did not harden sufficiently i had to put squares in mini muffin cups to box up for gifts keep the rest refigerated no big deal though because it was so we didn t care just ate it out of the fridge i am making it again this year and am going to try cooking it longer than 11 min to see if that helps,371
64856,108327,4,tis dish was to i did swith it up some due to content availability i did not have a purple onion or an orange i used 8 oz of canned mushrooms and 1 sliced green pepper 1 yellow onion and a creamy garlic herb sauce to coverlightly all my guys liked it real well,260
162300,1449637,5,my 8 year old son joel these with me for thanksgiving my dad s eyes got very wide when he saw our pie sized whoopie pies and he dove in we ours waaaay too big we think they should probably be more oreo sized rather than pie sized and we used pillsbury creamy supreme classic white frosting rather than the cream cheese filling because my mother s lactose intolerant also we added about 1 1 2 tsp vanilla and reduced the canola oil just slightly to compensate for the liquid somehow the pumpkin eggs maybe sposed to beat these first oil and brown sugar never got fluffy which me very nervous but they turned out huge don t use large ice cream scoop like someone suggested use some kind of tiny little scoop like a gravy spoon or something anyway we got a hoot out of these rich delish whoopie pies we think your dad s eyes will pop when you bring them out for dessert too just like my dad s for posting these kelbel,914

131957,213247,5,high on aroma points and appearance high on the low carb scale approx 5 net carbs though this is not a low fat dish it was to use the low fat versions of some of the ingrediants to it so on a warm evening this dish will easily become a one dish meal and a very satisfying meal this is a keeper,293
18147,445122,5,very very i also added fresh mushrooms and an entire package of bean sprouts i also added a can of bamboo shoots and sliced onions yum i will definitely this again,163

245182,585349,5,this was such an to follow and very i was lazy and didn t feel like going to the store for a loaf but the lasagna dinner required italian bread i had the ingredients on hand and since it was from kitten i knew it would be another winner even the hubby raved,257

10358,61995,5,i love monkey bread i don t it often because of the time and work but this makes it easier the other thing i do is lay out all of the biscuits on a cookie sheet or cutting board and then use a pizza cutter to quickly slice them all into the bite size pieces very quickly,270
5170,495475,5,i have these pancakes a couple of times now it is important to let the mixture sit for 10 minutes the batter seems really thick but after the 10 minutes it smoothes out i also used 2 cups milk the second time to thin it out a bit more i thought the original the pancakes too dense with my changes they turned out they are light and fluffy and hold up to syrup overall a i will be using this version from now on,410
187536,124404,5,goodness this bread was so here where we live bread is eaten as open faced sandwiches for breakfast lunch and sometimes what they call an evening meal dh takes many bread slices to work each day he said this was one of the best breads i had sent with him i followed the exact wonderful flavor and as stated a little crunchy crust and soft inside perfect bread for my machine i am making another loaf today 2 days after my first you for sharing this with us,456
63244,160019,5,these are so and too tastes just like the real thing only better i cooked them in my electric skillet at 325 for 6 min per side i got 12 i did the fork method when they were cool and toasted under the broiler fantastic thankyou for this i will be making these often,265
99476,9927903,2,this was a little too sweet based on what i 039 m used to beef and broccoli tasting like also perhaps i did something wrong but adding the cornstarch while cooking the beef ended to be sort of a mess it did thicken but it also left the cornstarch clumps with not enough liquid to absorb and so it was a little weird then you add more cornstarch later and that thickened the whole thing up too much i followed the exactly and that was my result if you take all that into account the flavor of the sauce was if not too sweet if i do this again i 039 d take out the cornstarch in the beginning reduce the sugar to 1 2 of what is called for and then proceed,653
26370,1623447,5,i this for father s day and it is the only chocolate cake you will ever need light and chocolately and mmm mmm i was a bit nervous about the amount of coffee but i need not have worried i frosted it with a vanilla flavoured boiled buttercream frosting from the king arthur flour co cookbook which was you for sharing,316
63375,20813,5,this rocks i added 1 2 cup of applesaauce in place of some of the butter and the cookies turned out wonderfull and sooo soft mmmmm,130
302553,232463,4,this really does taste a lot like zax sauce quick and wonderful with tonight s chicken tenders you for posting,110
157589,402327,5,i this tonight as a treat for my parents i added a little extra red pepper to it spicy though it turned out fantastic for sharing,129
52190,80778,5,very to and a variation from regular rice i ve this several times with different types of meat but i used brown rice everyone i served it to has loved it for the,161
486355,2001693227,5,this was a real winner at my house be sure to let the flour cook for a few minutes prior to adding milk otherwise it will lend a graininess this applies to any sauce with flour as an ingredient,193
399830,1301548,5,i used 1 cup sourdough starter 50 high gluten ww flour 50 high gluten pizza flour no additional gluten 1 cup cooked pearl barley 1 4 c seseme seed 1 2 cup cracked 9 grain cereal azurestandard com 1 4 c molasses perfect,218
57993,123132,5,this was the best salmon i ve ever had the flavor was i broiled it for about 5 minutes on low because after 30 mins it still wasn t cooked through i felt like i was at a restaurant for the,188
35436,2309273,5,very and taste,14
35411,47341,5,my family all loved this soup i was out of mushrooms so it without them and doubled the for my big family very quick and to and i got the leftovers myself for lunch it smelled and tasted wonderful on a cold blustery evening i even shared it with my indian neighbors who love to bring us curried dishes,301
44889,192849,5,quick and this today to go with grilled steak and roasted potatoes this will be a regular in our house,102
25962,110135,5,i really loved this the only thing i changed was to increase the brown sugar in the topping by 2t because i was using fresh peaches and wasn t sure if they were sweet enough i had no issues with the sweetness or the crispiness of the topping mine came out beautifully crisp and got rave reviews at the potluck i brought it to i m putting this one in my permanent file,367
196401,1374796,5,outstanding it as stated except for the microwave part i don t use the microwave when you use natural peanut butter there is no need to heat it up,146
17471,1641229,5,really the best channa masala there is on the internet without having to use a pressure cooker i substituted 1 tb of lemon juice for the amchoor powder and went on the cayenne since i can t handle too much spice turned out perfectly,232
168730,48305,5,light and refreshing to bring to a bbq the nextday would be in a lunchbox you could add olives and feta but it s as is,118
26420,112489,5,another review for this cocktail sauce this was so and i won t ever buy cocktail sauce again much better than store bought and i know what s in it,146
22765,60694,5,this is almost the exact my mom has been using for years and years originally she got the from a betty crocker cookie book our includes a sprinkle of salt as well the also says that you can substitute whole wheat flour for the plain and add 1 2 c chopped nuts although we do neither these cookies have travelled to many camps and many friends through the mail they also show up at lots of holidays the butter shortening and sugar brown sugar combos are what makes this cookie the absolute best choc chip cookie,510
316541,347873,5,i just ate six of these bad boys about 5 minutes after they came out of the oven so i have no clue if they firm up later or what they were very tender when fresh and warm mmmmm divine i used regular butter and i did increase the sugar and spice somewhat because i was making these for some guys who like their cookies fully loaded,330
25626,11461,5,tastes like a combination of a strata and a quiche just,55
21111,161265,5,so the best corned beef and cabbage i 039 ve ever followed the exactly for a winner,83
68842,2000353624,5,i surprisingly had all the ingredients for this in my fridge like another cook i increased the butter nuts and brown sugar i 039 m glad i did or they would have been too dry leftovers are fairly dry so microwave on low with wet paper towel the butter from the bread sweetness from the sugar and salt from the nuts was such a fun combination,340
22941,64682,5,excellent and so quick and to i only used 1 2 teaspoon red pepper flakes cause i am a wimp when it comes to hot stuff next time i will use the full teaspoon i also added sauteed fresh mushrooms and about 1 2 lb bay scallops just because i had them doubled the fresh herbs too the best news is i have enough left over for dinner tonight,335
134854,376712,5,i this with splenda and really enjoyed it,41
23038,248913,5,we loved it you,15
321997,1243640,5,just wonderful i cut the in half for just two of us but other than that didn t change a thing i thought it might be to sweet but it wasn t will be making this again,164
319371,2000574562,3,i this because i live in an asian country and all i have is a small oven i thought it would be cool to experiment with since some of my friends don 039 t have ovens i might have been off with a few ingredients it turned out to be pretty what i would suggest is the following 1 use only half the batch at a time the dough as directed but only use half in the crock pot if not just a third putting the rest in the fridge for a later date or just for eating 2 do it for 5 hours letting it rest on either low or no heat for another hour or so 3 if you can use a glove and the sides thicker and the inside thinner making a bowl type thing i did this minus the vanilla according to the directions given and it turned out pretty darn i think the main problem is that people use this with different crock pots you will need to experiment with it to find the right time and amount to fit your crock pot,893
107786,2000447331,5,tried this yesterday and it was fantastic didn 039 t have any smoke but they still tasted i especially liked the membrane removal trick the meat side down baking is the answer to get moist ribs thx,197
63326,745760,5,i can t believe i waited this long to rate this what a unique way to prepare salmon the maple is such a delightful contrast to the spices i think this would also work with chicken breasts and i plan to try it soon for another way to prepare one of my favourite foods,266
80082,778986,5,i am 71 years old and as far back as i can remember we have used this with watermelon we didn t eat watermelon without it it was always salted never used with sugar or jam i guess this was our family tradition this is a wonderful for sharing i tried this again since i wrote this review the first time a new discovery we had a few left over which does not happen very often i froze them today we bar b que d and i decided to try some of the frozen ones i thawed them to room temperature and then brushed them with bar b que sauce wow i put them on the grill away from the fire and they took on the smoke taste along with the sauce talk about bread with bar b que this is fantastic again for posting this,703
12039,978196,5,i this today and even though i d read it would probably taste better the next day and even though i didn t plan on having it until lunch time tomorrow it smelled so that i had to taste it and i ended up having it for lunch today it was d e l i c i o u s after i browned the sausage i squeezed it out in paper towel to eliminate some of the fat the only change i ll the next time i it is to use low sodium chicken broth and perhaps i ll use lean seasoned ground beef to it a healthier choice yum,494
148123,23466,5,this was a wonderful refresing salad next time i ll cut back on the sugar about half also i cheated by buying a bag of precut cabbage and i added about a quarter of one fresh jalapeno pepper chopped very fine,208
56366,716177,5,my family loved this i used lentils instead of split peas and pastini instead of the elbow macaroni these are what i had on hand i froze the leftovers and shepherd s pie with it 2 weeks later a real crowd pleaser i will absolutely again,236
13228,961714,5,for dinner last night we had a buffet of appetizers this honey mustard was a new piece i added to the meledy and it was a hit thks bunches,138
33752,2215753,4,we love carmalized onions so those i deglazed with a dry red wine added vegan veggie stock and a cube of not bullion until i had about six cups i also added hungarian paprika greek seasoning bay leaf roasted garlic and juice of one lemon i simmered for 40 minutes and let sit in the fridge overnight to meld favors these steps this soup stupendous and worth the extra work it is now both kosher and vegan,404
103337,1535689,3,the potatoes themselves were but i think the paprika was really too much and over powering i might this again but next time i will put alot less paprika,152
33869,197244,5,these have been my favorite since i was just little my mom would them for the holidays brings back memories for posting,119
21805,221996,5,excellent was looking for a sauce to use with stuffed chicken 116475 was a keeper and this one fit the bill just perfectly if you don t have marsala wine you can use sherry,172
10211,1891,5,had a boxed cake mis in the house nothing to frost it with found this it is really i am not sure how much powdered sugar i added as i just dumped until it was to the point i wanted it i know i did not add the full bag i am thinking about 1 5 pound for sharing,259
42679,487940,5,this is a makes a soft cookie and bakes well no matter how thickly we rolled it which is for cooking with kids i even a dough rope and shaped it into a gingerbread pretzel and that worked well too i half a batch used molasses and used whole wheat flour for half the flour needed and it tasted i also only chilled it for two hours since my kids couldn t wait any longer they loved making and decorating these cookies for sharing update after making this several times i wanted to note to be sure to use the smaller amount of flour otherwise the consistency is more like a cake and less like a cookie still my go to gingerbread,625
158768,578332,5,delish times 2,14
2687,288010,5,i this for an appetizer potluck at the office i baked it the night before then stuck it in the fridge i heated it up in the microwave and it was fine i recommend serving with panetini oven baked italian toast sold prepackaged at the grocer,239
92492,2000489306,5,i it at christmas and it was a huge hit i doubled the cream cheese 16 oz and roasted 4 garlic bulbs in the processor as it blended the garlic and cream cheese i added 2 tbs of quot perfect pinch quot italian seasoning a twist or two of the sea salt grinder and a couple shakes of the pepper shaker yum,301
169195,245915,5,this is the best shake freeze ever i love it i also it using fat free sugar free chocolate pudding and fyi if you are out of cool whip you can still it it s just use less ice and know that it s not as creamy as the original,223
123836,113339,5,the only thing i changed was the double chocolate chips that was because i could not find them in the store i just used regular chocolate chips and it was,154
53813,868335,5,these are i halved the and it 19 cut with a 2 1 4 inch glass i had in my freezer some sweet potato carrot puree used for sneaky chef recipes so that was a stand in the kids love these and they are way healthier than standard tea biscuits with the buttermilk sweet potatoes and butter instead of shortening served with roast lemon oregano chicken but most of them were gone as appetizers while we were waiting for the chicken to finish for a perfect will definitely these again,476
25730,50643,5,omg this is so incredible i too this to take to work and it was an enormous hit the dip is sweet creamy and nicely spiced as you suggested i served with gingersnaps and apple slices brilliant just plain brilliant i am definitely making this again for thanksgiving nurse di,272
78579,933723,2,after the other reviews i was hoping for something special but to be honest for me it didn t seem any better or worse than normal greasing of the tins my non stick tins that don t normally stick didn t stick using this but my muffin tin that tends to stick stuck just the same as usual,285
53854,510344,5,having recently returned from perth to sunny ole england i was after a for one of my favourite meals while i was there and i think i found it superb,148
22768,67327,5,fed this to my serious macaroni cheese lover and it was the best he has ever had,80
122416,837666,5,words can t even describe this pie the other day was just my first time even hearing about rhubarb and i was really curious about it then i saw rachel ray use it in a savory dish and she talked about how it is often used in pies so i looked it up and let me tell you i couldn t have been happier with the results it was and just beyond you,339
46072,2000577862,5,just like mom used to,21
44069,71938,5,i love these muffins i used white whole wheat for the flour omitted the fruit nuts and used egg beater instead of whole egg otherwise i followed exactly and they came out used paper liners and came out fine definately a keeper for a quick breakfast for the,256
108867,366781,5,i had a bunch of cooked shrimp from a party i forgot to bring it to i had no idea what to do with it until i tried this now i will cook shrimp just to eat this dish it was very i will cut back on the butter a bit next time as it is swimming in butter which was not necessary but everything else was perfect you so much for sharing,330
30471,289680,5,this may well be my new favorite spinach it has just enough flavor without any one flavor overwhelming it perfect,113
10744,2000168646,5,i find it how you all say this is a 5 star and then say quot i added this and that quot write your own submit it and then let others judge how or bad it is i just don 039 t get it,179
29679,1776469,5,such an and soooo,17
307532,584814,5,i love that these are so to taste wonderful and have such a unique presentation i plan to these when i have guests over and slice them into smaller portions you for posting,172
155963,206779,5,these were wonderful i followed the exactly with the exception of using all lean ground beef well drained and no italian sausage personal preference i also parboiled the peppers for 6 7 minutes dh must have told me at least 5 times during dinner how it was how could i give it anything less than 5 stars kitten for sharing this,327
146012,2524544,5,copy cat and very these this turkeyday and they were a big hit i was a little worried about fussing with a new for homemade biscuits and i don t like leaving too much to do at the last minute when you are trying to get everything on the table and hot but since i a lot of sides and gravy ahead i figured what the heck they really are to whip up and are a very close match to red lobsters will again might up cheese just a tiny bit,430
33170,505325,5,this was sooo so much princess buttercup i did it exactly as you stated in the except i submerged the chicken in the marinade and let it sit for about 2 5 hours i also used lots more pepper it was absolutely succulent so much,225
45809,917054,5,and i used garlic infused rice vinegar because it was the only vinegar i had in the house and it worked well i also mis read the measurements for the ginger i was using fresh grated root and put way too much in but this still came out if a little on the hot side a even i can t mess up is a treasure i served this with stir fried mixed frozen veggies broccoli beans snap peas red peppers carrots and almost everybody opted to just toss them with the chicken rice and sauce for a single dish meal i may just toss the veggies in to cook in the sauce next time,557
56453,270123,5,i really don t know what to say about this dish it s perfect everyone in the family thoroughly enjoyed it and there wasn t any for left overs i used 6 chicken cutlets instead of the breasts and used fresh grated romano cheese about 1 2 cup it was crispy yet moist and had just the right amount of garlic definitely a winner and will be often,341
28137,29088,5,flavor we were looking for something different to do with ribs and this definitely fit the bill the meat fell off the bones,123
145064,337657,5,a half of this with one can of chicken broth and a large chicken bullion cube tasted i will be making gravy this way from now on for a keeper,141
28199,32186,5,very to tasted absolutely i followed the exactly even my kids loved it for a,76
12199,1024982,4,rather too sweet it s a thing the cranberries added tartness,60
105424,2002036340,5,just it this morning on a whim was pretty to throw together and i m not a big baker or chef type i ll probably tweak a few things at some point one review said it was a little too much egg taste i loved that part i d probably use fewer apples next time just to get more of a pastry feel to the dish or use wait and put half of the apples on top halfway through will definitely it again,385
288831,1771936,5,this is my favorite from riverside cup of tea i lived on this during cancer treatments you so much for sharing dish,115
4042,1802391163,5,this dish was very i also put my own twist to it one thing i did is i cooked the squash in the pressure cooker for 5 minuets with some seasonings it raked out of the skin beautifully i used cheddar cheese and some baby spinach cooked it at 375 degrees in the oven came out my wife couldn 039 t believe it very,309
93041,28373,4,i liked this was easier to than i thought i it warm for hubby and added chicken breast instead of ham i had it cold the next day and it was even better i think gave it a little time for the flavors to blend i would cut back on the lemon juice next time though it was a lil bit sour with the artichoke juice in there as well oh i left out the asparagus couldnt bring myself to eat them even with this for a one,409
99898,129582,5,low fat cornbread i did add 1 4 cup sugar and about 2 tablespoons of parkay spray butter fat free and it was perfect for an,123
178228,397836,4,dh and i really liked this dish the sauce was rich and i used turkey bacon light sour cream and fat free chicken soup and i dont think it comprimised the taste we both agreed that the only thing we would change is to cook the chicken in bacon first then add the sauce or cook the sauce separately we like our bacon crispy xx,324
60228,342878,5,even my picky toddler loved this i ve spinach lasagna before but this is my favorite this will be a regular meal in my house,124
414811,1027968,5,this goes very well with moroccan chicken i left out the peas and baked 350 for 30 minutes after bringing broth to a boil with rice mixture rice turned out perfect i try to bake rice because i always mess up stove top rice i also added a pinch of red pepper,257
142563,423494,5,i was very happy with the way this turkey turned out i followed the exactly with the suggested additions of bay leaf peppercorn and garlic since it is cold here in idaho i just put the bucket with the turkey in the garage overnight it stayed cold without freezing i didn t follow the roasting instructions however since i like to cook it hot 400 degrees and fast to seal in juices my 21 lb turkey took 3 hours my dh wasn t sold on the idea of brining and thought it would be too salty after eating it he said we should do the turkey this way every time jenninjapan,564
152347,761153,4,very just found it to be a bit thin for my preferences because there were so many seeds i cooked the raspberries and lemon juice together then put the mixture through a sieve i then put the mixture back over the heat and added the sugar and cornstarch this removing the seeds a breeze and only took a minute to do,313
85199,230157,5,being from new england i most often a boston style of baked bean but i must say i loved these i love things with loads of flavor i did add a bit of chopped pickled jalapeno chili to this when i it for me though have to omit if my dad is going to be eating it what a pain as my husband mother and i like heat easily solved by serving some of the hot pepper on the side or hot sauce in the cookbook already and you,412
205861,479072,5,as others i was hesitant about velveeta but this turned out very i followed the exactly but did take the suggestion of adding some cheddar i added it at the last 10 minutes my cooking time was only 2 hours i would recommend spraying the crockpot more than lightly as mine was sticking and getting a little brown on the sides of crock pot i was out of batteries for the digital camera otherwise i would have taken a photo next time though there will be a next time for the comfy,477
47669,553331,5,spectacular this will be the only pancake i will use from now on i can t believe how light and fluffy they are given that they re 100 whole wheat i used light vanilla soymilk and followed everything else to the letter do not add more liquid they re perfection as is,265
63831,306897,5,wow i never thought these would end up tasting so i used wasabi mayonnaise instead of mixing the two and it was perfect,119
342957,438582,5,this tonight with some frozen blueberries picked last summer got rave reviews from my family including my chocoholic husband who proclaimed it to be his new favorite non chocolate dessert now that is quite an accomplishment leslie for a wonderful,246
100689,122541,5,my son prepared this dish for us last night he served it with a cilantro corn salsa and cilantro lime rice and corn tortilla shells combination i suspect this would be a way to prepare venison as well,200
151605,808746,5,this is a i added one chopped onion and two cloves of minced garlic to the pot i also added a few splashes of worcestershire as well the gravy is and is with mashed potatoes thanx for a,185
39087,1669604,5,this is wonderful i am so glad that i finally got around to trying it it 039 s quick to come together and absolutely delish me look like a rock star and family was very happy happy happy this is restaurant quality without spending hours in the kitchen and worthy of company too but for now the family isn 039 t ready to quot share quot any of this for this incredible,367
270510,476359,4,i really enjoyed this it was very to prepare i fried the fish in a cast iron skillet for about 1 minute on each side then i poured the glaze on the fish in the skillet and placed the whole thing under the broiler i basted the fish with the sauce every minute or so and broiled for about 5 minutes i think next time i would use more honey and less soy sauce the dijon gives just a hint and complements the sweetness overall very for the,435
29172,1164689,4,doubled the sauce and added red pepper flakes as suggested in some reviews very quick and it will be to use as a last minute lunch or dinner,140
255580,598391,4,this was a sauce though i feel it called a little too much garlic for my taste my girlfriend who loves garlic loved it if you want try adding some spaghetti sauce like ragu it adds a flavour for next time i ll be used less garlic and cream instead of milk all in all i was satisfied,282
92144,1362839,5,excelent also found a variation that is for sugar in pudding add 2 3 4 cups white also pinch of salt 1 2 cup toasted chopped pecans or walnuts and dot with 1 2 cup butter for sauce 1 c white sugar 1tsp vanilla use evan williams whiskey keep butter the same,256
11152,54886,5,absolutely the chicken tasted so i have a couple of times,57
69424,855476,4,hey this was a idea although the finished product for me was a little too much of one thing i used regular instant oatmeal with milk and some milk chocolate chips it probably would have been better with the semi sweet like suggested but i didn t have those also added some peanut butter to it,292
27652,14986,5,i followed the as written and was richly rewarded with a very dinner served with a mushroom spinach salad with bacon dressing,125
85800,589394,4,this did turn out in the end but i reduced the cayenne to 1 4 tsp and added an extra cup of chicken broth because it was really spicy for my tastes,147
106872,186085,5,what a crazy once again i had guests over and needed something fast and this fit the bill perfectly i didn t remember to pick up the chives and sour cream so we ate them plain although i can t say honestly say that because they were anything but plain my guests raved i halved small red new potatoes instead of medium potatoes,326
211540,465180,5,this is sooo vegan peggy hicks from florida,43
79212,226462,5,i this for a cooking class at the diet center where i work and it was a huge hit just the right amount of spice mine baked for 1 hour next time i won t break down the florets quite as small as i did this time the pieces shrink down a lot a guide to size is the first photo that is posted here bergy for a treat,310
154046,241696,5,extremely and quick to you can even use leftover rice and heat before making,76
31639,1802605395,4,this was very but the only reason i gave it four stars instead of 5 is because i felt that there was way too much of the sour cream mixture it drowned out the beans next time i it i will halve the sour cream mixture or add another can or two of beans,250
259348,2002287227,3,i cut the sugar back to 1 5 cups and it 1 cup granulated and 5 brown so maybe i shouldn t have but these cookies were cake like and not my preference i prefer vegan butter and though i mixed all the liquid to emulsify oil plus peanut butter they just didn t work for me,269
95896,2000747053,4,we liked these but not the texture i think it was just a mental disconnect between something being called quot mashed potatoes quot and the result not being smooth and creamy flavor wise i thought they were spot on which is why i did not want to add more cream and or butter would ve had to adjust the wasabi as well and didn t have time to bloom more i use the powder and you need to mix it with water and let it sit awhile i used smooth skinned yellow flesh potatoes so they were still just not mashed potatoes next time i think i ll try russets and do a twice baked style bake the potatoes split them remove and mash the innards and then return to the shell i will still add a bit more cream butter wasabi but i think it will work out better because your brain will have a better idea texture wise of what you re about to eat we had these alongside miso marinated black cod on serious eats and a spicy sesame cucumber salad https www instagram com p bl2prubj2uz,964
5190,171345,5,this is a that i will be making over and over again the only thing i did different was add a small tin of tomato sauce mixed in with the broth ingredients so there would be more gravy and it turned out to be,207
34059,148840,5,i used 5 lb yellow golden potatoes instead of the milk i used whipping cream because i needed to use it up prepared the night before and baked them in the morning an hour on 350 and turned the heat up to 400 for 15 min they had a brown crunchy top and creamy inside they were perfect will use this receipe again,311
180697,325543,4,this was very i used ground turkey instead of beef i cooked on low for 7 hours and the peppers started falling apart so i don t think i would have cooked it for 8 hours i liked it alot and would it again,203
148303,684070,4,this was a really at home version of my favorite chinese dish my only complaint is that it is too sweet next time i will only use 1 2 c sugar and i might even try brown i coated my chicken in corn starch and pan fried in oil before adding to sauce most authentic chinese restaurants use a coated chicken i m thinking my husband might like some red pepper flakes added also very for posting,389
118398,36739,5,i have this several times with excellent results but haven 039 t rated it yet today i used it as a topping for a pavlova it was a real treat with hindsight i realize that i should have drained the strawberries before adding it to the pavlova as it was a little too juicy but i love the juice so it didn 039 t occur to me i followed the directions to the letter and it was perfect,379
109637,845332,5,these are very perfect for bachelorettes like me who can t finish an entire meatloaf before it goes bad freezes and reheats beautifully for posting,147
180306,1425037,4,i tried this today and like one reviewer who said she the bread in a bread machine so that is what i tried i ended up with a 4 loaf which was very dense but with flavor so next time i will do it the old fashioned way and see if i have better results,249
35193,938908,5,this was a hit at a large two big tables family thanksgiving dinner i left out the onions subbed applesauce for the juice or cider and first cooked fresh mild polish kielbasa the real stuff but otherwise followed the and the flavors and sweetness were excellent i scaled the up 50 larger and used 3 lbs each of kielbasa and sauerkraut and none was left over and this was a table full of people used to polish and german cooking,427
286577,99221,5,this is i thought it was going to be too hot spicy at first but it was just right i did changes i used tabasco instead of hot pepper sauce i saut ed the garlic with the onions not for 2 or 3 minutes but until the onions were brown and carmelized coz that brings out the sweetness of the onions i omitted the cilantro coz my husband does not like it i also used slap your mama seasoning on the chops in addition to the chili powder this is a keeper crafty lady 13 chef judi coleman,480
28785,191548,5,tastes better than most take out,32
326883,1154939,4,served this along side chicken parmesan it a combination the noodles had a flavor i didn t include the parmesan cheese as i already had enough in the chicken dish and it was still will it again,193
13535,522122,4,i served this to two non vegan guests who loved it the presentation is the best part the flavor is fine although i agree with vegan mom s review i would recommend adding less than half the tomato sauce and including a little salt pepper sugar oregano rosemary and parsley,271
8782,32558,4,this is and inexpensive all my favorite ingredients,51
99717,195988,5,wonderful juicy pork the rub is excellent will definitely again for posting,75
253794,138047,5,lovely the mustard added a fabulous depth to the sauce i added some spring onions and fresh coriander at the end the family loved it,132
31128,868637,5,outstanding pie,15
17359,396380,5,these are absolutely i was hesitant about the pudding but it yields an amazingly bread so much,94
28148,934998,5,loved them my husband really enjoyed them too definetly will be making these again,82
44163,2000041947,5,spot on i and always keep this around,37
144128,416894,5,i loved this only two comments the steps don t say what to do with the water i assumed to beat with eggs but it could be a different sequence if batter doesn t spread thinly enough on its own i found the bottom of the measuring cup to do the trick rave reviews on taste from us and some guests,293
200821,600625,5,i was about to quit halfway through because rolling all the little balls of dough took forever for a new cook like me but it s worth every minute i added a little flour when rolling the balls to it not stick to my palms don t be alarmed at the size of the treat i was at first consider my cat s regular and treats are so much smaller but she ate it right out of my hand with no problems and begged for more when i was making my second batch took 2 cookie sheets to use up all the dough she caught on to what i was doing and started meowing nonstop in the kitchen brilliant i used regular flour instead of rye flour again i m a new cook and have no idea the difference between the flours and my cat loved it,706
9326,2001211915,5,these in my mini muffin pan and added m amp m s they were very will definitely use again,88
107075,171106,5,this sounds really the beer would add a really neat twang to the taste i haven t even tried it and i can taste it i am going to this one for sure,145
65768,172410,4,this was very quick and to and pretty,37
203261,765539,4,phenomenally ingredients and i liked the texture better than that of many naans a little moister and chewier but plenty fluffy for my preference and much easier than using yeast four stars because it was a bit bland i will add more salt next time and probably some garlic powder or other spices,294
19666,300508,5,my son loved these they were really i like salty and sweet the only thing i will do different next time is to use low sodium soy sauce you know just to it a little healthier i was really sceptical of the ingredient but it all worked out you for posting it,255
50767,292308,5,five stars no doubt i loved these dh said he d halve the cream cheese but i m a cream cheese freak so it stays i also added 1 c frozen chopped broccoli nuked 45 sec a sprinkle of cheddar and a tiny shake of dry minced onions used no chives oh and 1 2 and 1 2 instead of milk to use it up from another i m curious to see how it reheats but they smelled heavenly and tasted sinful the first time around note i used generic crescents no prob and 3 cans of cooked tyson chicken cause i don t do chicken update i was seriously concerned about reheating this the next day after it being in the fridge i nuked it 1 min and it was all soggy and nasty feeling so i popped it in the toaster oven on 300 deg for a few minutes and it came out and golden and crispy again yay,762
41685,190857,5,i tried this tonight and it came out wonderfully as the flavors were blending in the crock pot it filled the whole house with a robust aroma,140
11329,59351,5,i didn t have oil so used butter instead i also didn t have buttermilk so i soured some milk with lemon i also used 4 banana s as suggest by other posts i used almonds but can t really taste them instead of making one cake i 6 giant muffins and put the rest in a loaf tin the muffins worked the loaf is still cooking all lovely and brown on top but wobbly in the middle hopefully it sorts itself out i didn t use icing the cake is enough with out will definately again yum yum yum,480
57011,2001841619,5,these were i baked for 10 minutes both times with this and they turned out perfect i always add just a few drops of almond extract with russian tea cakes for an extra special hint of flavor and everyone just raves about how they are i bring them to christmas parties and they are always the favorite and first to be eaten i never refrigerate and i pack em on one pan as they do not spread i also triple dip them in the powdered sugar starting right out the oven when they are super hot,485
326401,727236,5,very rinse the capers,21
110071,1328641,5,and very different i used less salt than the called for and bake them at 275 for 20 minutes i will these again,110
291902,789766,5,i love this by far one of my favorite dishes it even tastes microwaved after being in the fridge for a few days the only downside is that it s so i might eat too much,166
25725,547279,5,we loved this i took it to the nursing home for dinner with my dad he sure i was passing the to my mom and my sister so he could have it again i lightened it up using pam spray lite yogurt and fat free milk was sooo,215
51455,244815,5,you i used this batter to boneless chicken nuggets with outstanding results the only thing i did was omit the ground red pepper because i a homemade buffalo sauce for dipping and was afraid this might be too much heat for my dh everyone raved about the batter i did add 1 2 tsp of baking soda and 1 2 tsp vinegar to puff it up a bit more after trying a few first in the heated oil this is now going to become my batter of choice i also used raw cut up boneless chicken breasts so i totally did away with the pre cooking of the meat really appreciate your sharing of this with the zaar,584
250063,667915,5,i have to agree with sherrybeth on this one loved the fact that these could be in one saucepan and then poured into the baking dish to clean up and to eat chewy not too sweet yet plenty sweet enough i m afraid we ll be eating way too many of these for posting lainey,266
426187,2000074819,5,and to next time i will add some pieces of quality ham excellent,64
46906,35488,4,but bland for me will try more worcester sauce and add salt and pepper next time,80
304943,494593,5,i used a duncan hines mix and following the exactly except i my own chocolate pudding came out i used chopped pecans for the nuts as we like them so much i topped with homemade whipped cream the name fits the cake it is for sharing mimi,236
39087,1802591589,5,a huge favorite around the house i it a couple of times a month also add fresh mushrooms to it,94
67042,76267,5,wow what a i served this and cranberry sauce at christmas dinner and everyone liked this so much no one ate the cranberry sauce it will definitly be part of our traditional dinner from now on you,195
41221,57787,5,very i doubled the and baked it in a 9x13 glass baking dish i pulsed the cottage cheese briefly in my processor to it smooth it s a texture thing and used a 4 cheese blend instead of the cheddar i diced a half of a red pepper and a half of an orange pepper and even with doubling it baked in approximately the same amount of time very flavorful and very filling,361
143271,2239881,5,my first attempt at bean soup and it was so and,47
37044,1450612,5,most excellent it was a bit of a wait and considerable eye strain reading the candy thermometer but well worth it if not just just for the aroma in addition gives me the option to it as thin as possible for old gummers like me,226
56818,2607070,3,my girlfriend said she really liked it i thought it was kind of bland this was not difficult to and it makes a lot of so it s if you have a lot of people to feed,161
364184,2000379699,4,idea i reduced the sugar a bit and used a different variety of pepper also i seared the outside it a cast iron pan before using a crock pot for about 6 hours but maybe i should have gone 8 the garlic came out like butter,220
78693,313369,5,omg i think i love you i love caramel popcorn but can never afford those little packages from the store too much cost for too little product and making it the traditional way is just too much work for a quick movie treat i tried this and it is perfect to the person who said it was too syrupy you need to stir it quite well before you add it to the popcorn you can even watch it thicken while you stir i thought this was the perfect amount for one bag but then i have quite the sweet tooth,489
99383,462571,4,a quick and dessert you for posting i also tried this with vanilla oreos and it was 1 3 cup melted butter saturated the cookie crumbs so i think 1 4 cup butter would be enough let the dessert sit out for about 10 minutes or so before serving to cutting easier and for the flavours to come through,296
45934,59949,5,i love these i these for a mexican supper appetizer and for parties they are a big hit i left out the pimento and the dressing after i cut them i spread them on a platter and have a bowl of salsa to dip them in they are excellent i recommend this for any carry in occasion,272
129926,1741901,5,it was a meal i added a little tabasco sauce to give it a little heat the second time i it my boyfriend couldn t stop eating it i ve it twice in the past 3 weeks,161
239007,423780,5,my gosh these were the bacon fat is a must i grew up in san diego and this is one thing i really miss dawnie,108
68379,359759,5,i halfed the and got 6 muffins which is considering i ate a lot of the batter these were completely you so much for the vegan,125
13555,759078,5,absolutely i halved the and then opted to three large servings i divided the batter in thirds and cooked the cakes in extra large coffee mugs i added about 3 minutes baking time for the increased size of the servings before baking i sprayed the mugs w baking spray instead of sugaring them i served the cakes still in the mugs and garnished each w vanilla bean ice cream these were a hit w my husband and our company also i melted the chocolate and butter in the microwave instead of in a double boiler to do this i used a glass mixung bowl i put the chocolate in for 90 seconds stirred and then added the butter i checked the mixture and stirred every minute until it was melted,679
157594,788275,4,i served this on 64435 for our fake out outback steak dinner and this butter really complimented that sweet bread i did leave out the dill because i didn t have any we also used it on rye crackers w lunch meats the next day i will be making it again,249
484420,1803730992,5,this last week when unseasonably warm weather inspired me to grill outside in january it mixed up super quickly with my immersion blender i didn 039 t have any chipotle powder so i subbed adobo from leftover chipotles i had in the fridge but i was otherwise faithful to the as written my husband and i loved it the chicken was mildly spicy moist and flavorful on night one and i took the leftovers to work the next day for a mexican inspired salad definitely a keeper,467
474518,2195275,5,ok this is the best ken hope you have more like this one,56
95311,1452290,5,these are the best in homemade chicken noodle soup but also with stroganoff i ve tried this in my kitchenaid pasta maker dealy the combo meat grinder style and well that thing just doesn t work best to just roll it thin and slice it i m lazy and impatient so i often just slice mine in squares or wide strips they freeze well too,329
224457,403996,5,already had a for the pancakes but i tried the fresh peach sauce it is it went very well w the pancakes we but i m sure that sauce would be on some ice cream or yogurt as well mmm for posting,191
11345,2001313949,3,dough was super sticky my 7yr old son couldn t really manage to get them on to the pan right they were okay possibly better frosted they seem very dry to me somewhat bland,171
526984,2001429082,5,love these i added nuts 1 banana nutmeg and cinnamon,52
82777,404483,5,this was so to and so i will absolutely this again,50
5000,651269,4,this was and my family loved it,31
151153,1157312,5,i ve never tasted or eaten quinoa before but this was i did toast the quinoa first as per 16399 this doesn t mention how much salt to use so i went with about a teaspoon also it does not say how much spinach so i used about two cups will definitely again,254
176420,1270478,5,they were i found them a lot like bannok but yummier,52
54529,2000144915,4,these are i didn 039 t have rice flour so i used chana chick pea flour and they still tasted i also added a packet of dr oetker vanilla sugar,141
30292,58562,5,this was outstanding it hit the spot for my dh and myself i added a few things to stretch this dish as i could tell i wanted to eat it for a few days i added a half a chopped bell pepper a can of water chesnuts a can of crabmeat some frozen peas dill and some old bay seasoning i also used precooked frozen shrimp i will be making this next week for the forth of july i am going to with out pasta and put on hoagies for an shrimp salad sammie you so much,454
17522,2000880668,4,very and i didn 039 t have any vanilla extract to use either however i have to question is so much sugar healthy in this and then to also add confectioner 039 s sugar and possibly maple syrup on top i had to drink 2 tall glasses of water with this french toast so though,270
24562,37914,2,i had hopes for this but it was too watery the combination of ingredients is excellent thicken it up and it s a winner,118
66648,352536,5,this is a tasting marinade my husband and i really enjoyed it i have already this marinade twice thus will use this marinde as much as i can for the marinade,157
83475,791287,5,we recently moved and i haven t found a local chinese place yet now it seems i don t need to this was and outstanding,117
258241,2001922553,5,loved em hubby makes dry old fashioned cornbread and i decided to this instead he was pleasantly surprised you so moist and,123
26230,1283101,5,my husband has been asking me to master sweet and sour sauce for a very long time now it has always been quite dissapointing as it never turns out as expected and i then return to buying jars which taste sooo artificial in flavour i came across this in a last attempt to master much loved sauce and hey presto the best sweet and sour sauce tried and tested yet the whole family enjoyed this today it was a success really very to prepare and fantastic results i might just add a little less vinegar next time but that would be all fantastic home sauce that beats any jar and is full of flavour and taste you a big hit,616
37605,614012,5,my husband and i loved this we thought it was the best scallops we have ever had i followed it exactly as far as cooking times and amounts except for a couple of substitutions i used mandarine oranges instead of pineapple putting them in at the same time as the rum using coconut rum i also added 1 4 c of fresh coconut instead of coconut extract the rice was a wild rice blend which went perfect with the fruity spicy flavor flavor,432
292264,2001465841,4,i this yesterday with very few changes except for one big one the timing 60 70 minutes is way too long to roast chicken and veggies honestly i m astonished that few if any other reviewers have mentioned that the time is too long especially at 425 degrees i normally roast bone in chicken at 400 degrees for 40 minutes maximum turning the chicken once that is the temp time at which it comes out and it did i did use regular potatoes instead of sweet potatoes and added asparagus for the last 15 minutes or so the veggies came out as as the chicken but again 60 70 minutes and everything would have been way way overdone,619
278872,146742,5,it is a appetizer for any occasion at home or to take to a gathering this is already a favorite,95
180770,2216812,5,these are about as close to the platonic ideal of an oatmeal raisin cookie as i can ever hope to find crispy on the edges with chewy but not doughy centers a real find after years of flaccid overly sweet failures i plumped the raisins in hot brandy and used dessicated coconut instead of flaked to up the moisture difference i didn t adjust the flour also because i live in mexico where the standard granulated sugar is actually light brown instead of the super refined white we get in the states i used a cup and a half of that omitting the brown sugar and called it i let the dough rest for a few hours to develop the gluten for extra chewiness then rolled and flattened them using the bottom of a glass they didn t spread much and took about 12 minutes to bake on a greased seriously don t forget the grease cookie sheet if there s one criticism it s they re a teensy bit eggy but eggs here tend to be a lot more intensely flavored than their us grocery store counterparts so if you re using strong flavored eggs from a local farm you might want to omit one yolk you chef itchy monkey for my new go to oatmeal raisin cookie it s been a long time coming,1155
325674,1119080,5,wow this was very rich and definitely add the chocolate chips i added some vanilla ice cream and hershey s chocolate syrup on the side my boyfriend and his roommate just went crazy over it,188
33914,212145,5,and stupid i topped mine w green onions you can add so much to this o,69
12406,66987,5,this was perfect the seasoning was just right i will it again,61
25885,667915,5,i have many different banana breads and i have to say this is one of my favorites one of the things about it other than the texture and flavor is the fact that there are so few ingredients things that are always on hand for a,225
116166,127180,5,this was excellent the only change i was the pudding i used banana cream instead of vanilla it turned out and was enjoyed by everyone there,139
110140,153750,5,this was very even better the next day,38
305787,385999,5,yum this was really i added an extra 1 2 onion because i love onions i used vegan margarine spelt flour and hemp milk i also used soy cheddar chees and turkey bacon i followed the directions as given and the taters were a bit hard but you know i liked them that way with the creamyness of this it didn t matter i don t think mushy taters would have been better my dh loved this as he s a real mr potato head for the tasting comfort,431
102617,2001359614,5,my mom s which i have always used is almost identical mom never measured except when following a baking and that was subjective too a darn thing but that is how they did things by taste i do the same anyway i do not use any sugar and use much more pepper never a scoop left share you,283
20107,226007,5,i have used the same ingredients for this without the vinegar but i think it the difference mixing it all together first was better that just putting each on separately juicy and tender,185
54187,728181,5,kielbasa is a addition to this i put it on the 8 hr setting on my crockpot and added some extra water big mistake it came out very mushy my fault still next time i will follow the directions to a t,197
53614,359724,5,kittencal does it again i didn t refrigerate the meatballs and they were ok but misshapen i used low fat hamburger and no pork didn t leave enough oil in pan so had to add the water in sooner thickened up even with the modification low fat it was fabulous,255
46078,355621,5,i absolutely loved them d one of the best appetizers i ever had,63
58480,207257,5,these were delectable i followed all of the directions except i omitted the bacon and the sprinkle of parm at the end just to cut down on some of the fat and they were still excellent i had doubled the to enough for 8 because i had them for a dinner party that was supposed to be for 6 8 people but only 4 of us it and the 4 of us polished these off in no time will be making these little addictive treats again soon,416
339998,1136885,5,this was my 3 kids and hubby loved it and i will defiantly this again i have been looking for a for thick cut chops and this is a winner perfectly seasoned you,159
19190,43654,5,stop look and listen you have just been fortunate enough to stumble onto one of the all time greatest recipes ever ingredients for this cake costs in the vicinity of 30 to but you won t regret a penny of it this cake is not just rich it is sinfully rich but it is packed with flavor this cake is better than any dessert i have ever had in any restaurant ever and i have eaten in some fine restaurants you will definitely love this cake and people will think you are genius for making it if you find someone who doesn t like this please email me and let me know immediately because they are an alien,598
54225,2002104222,5,easiest brownies to and the best,32
238838,1500418,5,i had these in spain and loved them i didn t love the hangover after having too many though,91
23041,99217,4,really dessert i found that my first batch came out a little too greasy though on my second try i left out the butter and they came out perfect absolutely peanut butter flavor and and chewy,189
67072,56341,1,i read the reviews and decided to try my luck since most people didn t seem to have the rising too high center falling problem as one reviewer did however i had the same problem i started this up before i left for the evening and came back to a sad sunken in loaf i m not skilled enough with bread to revise it to it work so i won t be trying this one again,357
33919,1572451,5,this receipe was hubby returned for seconds i a few changes just because i wanted too and had the ingredients i put a whole onion in i had a 1 2 a cereal bowl of chopped celery carrots onions and green peppers left from other casseroles and i thew them in the hamburger i used the homemade taco seasonings used black beans and used twice as much mushroom soup and sour cream i think the original would have been but i hate to waste things and had these on hand,460
99795,2000579455,1,no as far as i learned followed the directions step by step when i stirred in the brown sugar and butter it solidified very quickly i could barely stir it so i added the corn syrup i ended up with chunky corn syrup not,218
63919,1803464104,5,thick and meaty flavor,22
140340,2143175,5,this was and i very little changes i seasoned the meat with salt pepper and garlic powder i also cooked it at 300 for 1 1 2 hours it was wonderful with creamed potatoes and steamed broccoli will be cooking this again,216
129167,26719,5,i grew up in canada with this soup and as an adult i it frequently in the winter it is so quick and to whip up and it is so comforting on a cold day lennie 039 s version is perfect as the original calls for cannes of consumme and i always use beef stock broth i do rinse the ground beef before adding to the soup otherwise there is a bit of grease on top this freezes very well,377
59806,64713,5,dip i it for the 4th weekend and it was gone in what seemed like seconds for a recipie,86
49172,355272,3,these were sooo cheezy i really liked them i them when i was in a cooking mood but i didn t want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen and these were so to and the result was that i had really cheezy cheesepuffs but after my third cheesepuff i got a little bit nauseous maybe because it was to cheezy my little brother also liked them so i recommend this especially when you like cheese xxx,390
77403,358284,5,this soup is highly nutritious and definately worth trying i will be making it again as i ve been looking for zucchini recipes to use up the annual overflow from my garden this is very quick and with very few ingredients watch you don t cook the stock down too far or it gets an odd taste to it i also mixed some of the soup in with the egg mixture before adding it to the rest of it my toddler ate it all after i bar mixed her bowl and my husband said it reminded him of an asian soup probably because of the egg drop i didn t use the full amount of stock and probably used more rice but followed the rest of the as written we only got about 4 cups which was enough for 2 modest serves and a little one this would be a spring soup and a beautiful light accompaniment to a meal with seafood and white wine for posting,817
138939,194886,4,i really enjoyed this i had no idea what a chipple and it intrigued me it was such a dish but was really flavorful i enjoyed and i plan on making it again my dd really enjoyed it and ate several pieces,201
104227,142200,5,my family loves this you for posting,36
3474,55829,5,i followed the to a t the pasta was perfect light tasting and so fresh we did this by hand it does take some muscle well worth it in my opinion i might triple this next time and freeze some if you use enough flour there is no need to dry it,240
132263,979991,5,these pancakes were the perfect consistency fluffy and i used vanilla soy milk and it a delightful flavor for this,114
31799,567959,5,way to use up the cheerios i had sitting in my pantry i used honey roasted peanut butter and it added a sweet nutty taste you,125
385365,1238056,5,these brownies are a real kid and husband pleaser i had to bake the brownie about 30 minutes instead of 20 25,109

17113,323752,5,these were to and my family loved them the dough was very thick almost too thick to hold the chocolate chips so i had to add a little more butter so i could work with it,169

46427,207907,4,this cake was really and baked up perfect i it for my boyfriend s work they all seemed to like it but i sure they saved me a piece so i could rate it i prefer a more heavy texture i think,187
59130,74736,5,this was soooo anyone that is hesitant to it because of ingredients or prep time don t be the process actually went quite quickly the only thing i did differently was to leave out the breadcrumbs as we try not to eat them evelyn ok ed when i first looked over the i though it looked looked like every other lasagna type dish i ve seen well it is not the meat is so well flavored much more so than anything i have had before and the bechamel sauce is heavenly no more sprinkling plain cheese over the top of anything for me this was my first time making eggplant and evelyn steered me to a winner you a convert out of me for the terrific,636
22576,117833,2,very to but didn t have alot of flavor next time i ll add spicy salsa or some jalapenos to give it a little kick,112

163297,322326,5,these were divine i halved the and it worked out perfectly this seemed like the gates to heaven when i found it i gave up refined sugar for lent daddy tried them and could only take a mouthfull becasue he said they were to peanut buttery but to be honest that s not a complaint becasue he is not a sweet kind of person anyway mummy loved it and so did big bro for posting miss pixie x x x,388
124054,377592,5,the best dill relish i have ever tasted all of the flavors meld together and then pop i did reduce the sugar and used zucchini instead of cucumber had some left over from making a sweet zucchini relish,201

7156,1387401,5,i have been craving french onion soup but did not have the patience to the famous barr s french onion soup i used only beef bouillon and had no kitchen bouqet and i used a toasted english muffin instead of croutons i thoroughly enjoyed this soup give it a shot with what you have in the house,292
12677,535033,4,this meatloaf is very especially since i usually don t like meatloaf at all the extra veggies really help due to allergies i subbed tapioca flour for the oats and wheat germ and soy milk for cow milk the first time i accidentially added the steak sauce to the mix it helped keep the meatloaf moist so i ve continued doing that also we tried freezing the raw mix and baking it later it came out fine,398
122033,281701,5,very the strawberries and balsamic paired well just loved the sweet sour flavor combination along with the black pepper i actually used fresh ground pepper melange yum,167
200469,652568,5,this worked out well i a ton of it around christmas time and decided to wait until i opened it to rate it excellent kahlua taste like the expensive store bought without the store bought price the down side is that you should wait as you mentioned i tried it when i first it didn t taste all that for a kahlua i did add one teaspoon of coconut flavor along with the vanilla which was simply by accident but worked out well picked up the wrong bottle lol you for posting this,473
93283,110433,5,omg this is wow what a hit i ve been waiting two years to try this recipie it just never seemed like the right time to it tonight i brought it as dessert to our friends place since we were going for dinner i can t believe the 4 of us devoured it even my husband and he usually doesn t take dessert i followed the recipie exactly and it was perfect i sure to soften the butter otherwise it won t mix into the dough well and i cut into about 22 pieces i think i ll go 24 next time although this size was pretty keep in mind the more butter that s on them when you dip the more likey you re cake might fall apart into pieces when you take it out also when layering the pieces do it igloo style so that it hold s it s structure better and can be pulled apart i drizzled the cake with icing sugar milk glaze this cake was so fun to eat and tasted even better i can t wait to it again i got home around 11pm and if i had more brown sugar i think i d be baking another cake right now update i have this cake about 5 times or more in the past 2 1 2 months every time it is a huge hit it tastes and it so fun,1099

4627,1138164,5,this is my favorite i add corn and black beans and leave out the milk,69
184667,95763,5,this smells sooo when it is cooking i also added shallots and garlic i used one 28oz can of fire roasted tomatoes that i hand crushed and one quart of chicken stock so i would have more liquid omitted the wine since i had none on hand added one can of artichoke hearts quartered with the beans and one box of cut spinach just before adding the chicken back to the pot served over savory polenta will definitely for company,422
184925,1474453,5,this was a twist on meatloaf i ve tried this with both ground turkey and ground beef the turkey works well but the beef makes for a much tastier dish the filling is absolutely this is a favorite in our home,206
251995,853762,4,wow i ve always loved spring rolls and wanted to them myself came across your and tried it last night boy o boy where they hot spicy hot i omitted the pork and fried the veg s because i believe carrots onion and cabbage become sweeter when fried i substituted the noodles for bean sprouts which i also added to the frying pan for the last few minutes to soften them the rolling was very i did realize after the 2nd 3rd one that the less mixture the easier it was to fold and then remained and tight and thin i kept enough mixture to one with out the spices and preferred that one so next time i won t add the cayenne pepper or garlic chilli sauce for sharing so happy i found your now i can my own thai spring rolls btw even my very fussy mom enjoyed them and that is saying something lol,788

14499,121871,5,oh my goodness this was excellent i used a french vanilla cake mix and french vanilla pudding and pecans i baked it on thursday evening for a sunday dinner i also plumped up about 1 cup of raisins then poured off the water and soaked them in 1 2 cup of rum overnight then another batch of the glaze using the rum soaked raisins i served a piece of cake french vanilla ice cream over it with warmed rum raisin sauce over both and freshly whipped cream over that i was in a paula dean mode for sure so much for sharing this carol,527

31280,274212,1,sorry we did not care for this at all and it had a really strong fishy taste it may be my fault i used phillips blue crab,121
221471,366238,5,hubby took this to work and it was a huge hit everyone enjoyed it used honey roasted sunflower seeds which added to the flavor and the granny smith apples gave it the crunch,173
46656,62085,5,this was a wonderful salad i increased the white wine vinegar to 1 2 cup because i like the zestiness it adds to the flavor had a fresh zippy zing to it this would be for any occasion and will be used alot here,210
442185,2691393,5,so came out fluffy although i thought they were going to be heavy because of the dough weight but i took my first bite and had to look at the biscuit i just bit in to like quot i this quot lol sooooo happy i tried this will definitely use it again may never buy biscuits again,276

329290,1004184,5,i think this is the best ice cream i have ever had much less i used 1 5 cups of sugar instead of the splenda and used about 3 4 cup of heavy whipping cream i also didn t chop my strawberries i was lazy and just let the machine spin them into smaller pieces if i had more whipping cream i would as many batches as i could darn i m out,333
37488,2001742373,1,there is flour so this is not gluten free can almond or rice flour be substituted,81
384745,288056,5,excellent marinade i left the ribs in all day in the fridge and they were so we didn 039 t even use bbq sauce i didn 039 t have any stone ground mustard so i used spicy brown but i only had about 2 tsp of it it was still excellent i 039 ll definitely use this every time i ribs,277
133914,602843,5,this is the best one out there i use the 15 oz cans of beans and one each of the smaller cans of beans and a one pound bag of bird 039 s eye frozen green beans i leave all the other ingredients as per the i sometimes add black and green olives and a stalk or two of celery diced yum,282
22765,48692,4,i these to take to work and they were uniformly oohed and aahed over they are and soft and very rich lot s of requests for the for posting,138

360565,2001940613,3,taste but it s super juicy not really a casserole this is a start to something but it either needs rice or something to absorb the juice unless you want a greasy soup we this and add cream of mushroom soup to thicken for a crawfish etoufee but we still put it on top rice or baked potato,287
97496,2002081688,5,this snickerdoodle has to be the best i have ever or have tasted for that matter the cookies were crispy chewy and delicous i followed the to a quot t quot and they came out perfect with out any complication,207

157590,993709,4,although the turned out fine pinto beans were prefered as a side this may a filling for burritos however i may try them that way next time kelbel,145
429567,150317,5,my greatgranddaughter makes these and they are delious,54
148513,234978,5,wonderful flavor i love couscous and am always looking for a new way to it this was quick and a hit with my family even my two year old you could easily add chopped cucumbers to this or small cubes of mozerella and a few basil leaves for a couscous caprice kind of feel,269
115440,208631,4,was quite and to i d recommend 1 tablespoon of fish sauce to start some fish sauces are very potent others no so also used rice noodles instead of rice lime instead of lemon and nappa cabbage for the cabbage requirement,219
64037,57898,5,wow this was a crowd pleaser i it as posted except for 2 things i used chicken broth and a veggie cream cheese it was fantastic and i will it again and again worth the time and effort so much nurse di,200
240430,365368,5,the flavors were i ll be making this all the time now everyone loved it and it s enough to throw into the freezer for busy days my only complaint is that there wasn t more of the sauce left because it was so,207
264532,291292,5,i so dislike reading reviews and people say they a but add this or that and change this or that i these today and i am being one of those who changed something i have never bought dates in all my yrs i had cranraisins though so chopped them and added them in replace of the dates for the start and i guess all in all changing things from time to time is one way new recipes are created and 5 stars for you,405
175230,2252749,4,i this for my partner and myself last night we both loved it i added zuccini and used thin hokkien noodles instead i also used reg pb and soy sauce i would have added some peanuts if i had any for us it wasn t too sweet or too salty and just the right amount of spice could have added more if i wanted a hot spicy dish,318
112979,836822,5,i just the dressing and it came out this is going to be my go to dressing for company i did use an immersion blender to mix it because the whisk wasn t cutting it i used about a cup of oil half evoo and half canola i also added a pinch of sugar,244
19779,262104,5,very to and a wonderful i added mixed herbs rosemary thyme oregno and chillie flakes tasted real for non meat eaters use chopped tomatoes carrots and cauliflower instead of ham for a,182
373124,1413070,5,this was perfect just the right amount of heat and flavor a must use,68
28026,1926335,5,oh these are so and so what could be better than that,53
455068,1745502,5,this tastes a lot like the meat version we both liked it better the next day luckily there were enough left overs we could both take it for lunch instead of chipotle peppers i charred my green peppers and that gave the smokey flavor and then added an ancho for spiciness i used 1 2 butternut amp 1 2 white potatoes dh usually doesn 039 t 039 like butternut squash but didn 039 t 039 even notice it in this dish as the flavors meld so well i used canned black beans so glad to have a vegetarian version of this dish in my life we had to add salt at the table so next time i would add it while cooking,599
122591,228313,5,oh my have just wolfed down one of these delectable morsals and they are i used about 1 5th wholemeal bread flour extra milk and missed out the rum flavouring as i didn t have any i was too scared to add actual rum instead i increased the cinnamon and added vanilla to the icing my skill at baking does not run to the wonderful bun pictured but i managed to create ugly little treasures for this one dreamgoddess to be repeated,427
132546,1308381,2,just by reading the i knew that the sauce will be very sweet but i still gave it the benefit of the doubt and followed it i should have trusted my gut i am sorry but this is certainly not chinese or asian at all if you are looking for a westernized version of chinese sweet amp sour sauce then perhaps you may like it but if you are chinese or asian this is certainly not for you i grew up eating chinese not here in the us but in a real authentic chinese community from my asian birth country this is why i know i still gave two stars for the batter though which was,567
74365,2465515,5,super to and leftovers are for lunch at work,44
31516,23960,5,soooooooo i this last tuesday evening and my husband wants to know when i am going to cook this again so to especially after a long day at the office i will be making this over and over you for sharing the,205
31371,2000671295,5,can t go wrong here just the perfect touch of onion i cooked up some parmesan crusted salmon and broccoli with the squash,121
128952,412847,3,this was pretty i was really excited for this but in the end it did not taste like coldstone cake batter ice cream it was a cheap alternative and i will probably it again but don t expect perfection,198
146427,1023808,5,i served these at my new year s eve party and they were gone in 5 minutes very,78
28900,641776,3,this was but not a fav i too added onion and peppers and that turned out really well back up since most stuff you already have in the house and thats exactly what i was looking for when i found this one,202
120015,511620,5,these are a snack i used a mexican cheese blend instead of just chedder and red bell peppers they taste and smell,113
14763,463231,5,this was the first time i ever a soup from scratch it was the whole house smelled so as this was cooking the meat was so tender and fell off the bones i would cut the amount of beans in half next time as this is a very filling soup i added some chili powder paprika and cajun seasoning as it was cooking and jack daniel s barbecue sauce probably a whole cup i tasted it after each 1 4 cup it was big hit with my boyfriend and me will definitely again,450
151177,2000361673,4,it was so we will it again com,30
80130,461472,5,these were fantastic a full five stars for sure i came across the while looking for another one which uses plantains i had never prepared them before but they were so to in the oven and absolutely i couldn t stop eating them straight from the pan and bought four more at the store yesterday i will be making these often quite possibly my new favorite snack,356
65468,538190,5,this salsa is to die for i used half lime half lemon juice though it was spectacular,84
8430,333687,2,does not specify if should remove from pan when warm i did and just like the other reviewer the blueberries stuck and the cake looks awful also ingredients for glaze are not porportionate and should be powdered sugar very dissatisfied,234
33009,332937,4,i used an oreo cookie crust it was i was just unsure how frozen it should be to serve,85
202755,1454052,5,this was a it will definitely become one of my standard dishes to bring to a party and to serve when i have people over i served it as a side last night with 180496 and my husband had seconds of everything can t wait for leftovers tonight,238
73578,133778,5,love these muffins after reading others comments i did reduce the oil to just 3 4 cup and only 2 eggs and they are light and moist i the jumbo muffins and bake them for 45 minutes we freeze ours pop them in the microwave for 50 seconds and have a warm muffin every morning with our coffee,288
317515,194886,4,this is a really and to for dinner i did omit the white wine since i don t drink it and it would just go to waste in my house i m sure it would of imparted a lot of additional flavor instead i added extra chicken stock i also used my own version of herbes de provence and found the dish with the addition of the 30 cloves bursting with flavor this was for fall pac 2008,369
111942,939875,5,my husband devoured most of this soup the minute it was done and he s not a big greens fan i just used regular jarred parm and a can of northern beans the little bit of olive oil on the top makes it plus we had some sesame artisan bread for dipping so will definitely it again escarole is not always readily available so i am wondering if another green might work with this soup say kale or something,400
19655,167242,5,love this i this for lunches all the time whip up a double batch on a monday and eat it for lunch all week it s really adaptable i add other veggies whatever spices i m in the mood for etc i generally add cabbage because i love it and add lots of extra garlic and plenty of spices it tastes and there s a bonus when i have a 200 calorie or so lunch i get to eat a bigger dinner,377
127958,576676,5,the author is seriously not kidding about illegal religious experiences the only thing i changed when i this was to replace the brandy with red wine i had a bottle open for drinking with dinner anyway next time i it though i m going to replace the roasted garlic with the jarred minced sort not because i thought it was bad or anything but merely because i felt it didn t a huge enough difference to warrant the hour it me wait to snarf this stuff down nom nom nom,464
79308,375722,5,i m not a chile fan but decided to try this when i needed to find something to do with my defrosted ground turkey it turned out really well i m not much into heat so this amount was perfect especially when you have children to feed i don t have a crock pot or dutch oven so i used a regular pot and simmered for a half an hour and it turned out fine all the leftovers were eaten too,382
499315,2001919065,4,added raisins and a little honey they turned out really you can t expect them to have the texture of flour based cookies but things like raisins and nuts help,158
11194,36927,5,traditional,11
149113,837113,5,and though i preferr not to add french onion pkt and i use olive oil as they say its the healthy oil,100
17086,928301,5,i loved it so much better than mixing honey and butter and trying to get a result,81
4392,275349,5,i ve been making this for several years i recently moved and lost my cookbook this is the same except i use twice the spinach and save the bread from inside the loaf to mix with the spinach dip before returning to the loaf as a serving dish it s always a hit remember to save the top of the loaf for your cover,310
31266,2415380,5,these wings are be sure to extra the 2nd time i these i used spicy southwest mustard instead of the dijon and marinated the wings overnight fantastic we couldn t get enough what a keeper,186
22698,36540,1,these muffins were awful they reminded me of the the baked goods i tried to when i was five it seems as if the didn t call for enough things and no oil to moisten the muffins the outside was hard and stick to the paper cups the inside tasted like unsweetened dough if anyone knows why they turned out like this please tell me,325
111734,619761,5,i was skeptical at first but this is everyone loved it and that s hard when it comes to my family of 6 picky eaters for sharing,127
68063,2001595841,1,used pork loin chops and they turned out very tough,51
378778,116903,5,this was the i used while competing in 4 h many moons ago won me purple ribbons every time,90
52478,396078,5,i this for dinner tonight to accompany spaetzel my family and i of course devoured it scraping every last lick of the sauce off the plate i did change up the a bit i used very thin cut turkey cutlets instead of pork simply because it s all i had substituted heavy cream for sour cream due to dh s aversion and omitted the dill another of dh s aversions the turkey schnitzel turned out moist tender crispy on the outside and seasoned just right and the sauce oh the decadent velvety sauce was wonderful over the schnitzel as well as the spaetzel it was truly a rich and flavorful german sunday dinner for sharing this yum,620
333618,2000140155,5,i said i wasn 039 t going to do it but i ate the whole tray they were just that i cut my potato in to julienne pieces and cooked them a little longer to them a little crispy,173

11266,666260,5,i ve used brines before and this is one of the bests put a smell in my cold garage where i had my 33 1 2 turkey in a cooler of the brine reminded me of walking into my neighborhood butcher and sausage shop of years ago i would add that if you plan on using the drippings from the turkey for your gravy it s going to be on the salty side the turkey itself will turn out perfect with no salty taste at all,403
27144,761140,5,this cake is ridiculously no joke i have had friends tell me this is the best chocolate cake they have ever had it is so you can t pass up the opportunity to share this with someone the glaze is but if you have people who are less chocolate crazy like my strange friends you can just sift powdered sugar on top to enhance a beautiful bundt cake design be creative,363
477523,610488,5,glad this one could be pre since i had my hands full with other recipes needing to be served hot to the guests at my tapas party flavor and combined well with the other dishes i had available to taste,200

71849,1801538226,5,i didn 039 t have any eggs and wasn 039 t gonna risk anyone 039 s life by driving drunk to get any these turned out yum as hell i think i even like them better than the egg ones i 039 ve i changed the amount to 6 cookies cause i 039 m already fat so i didn 039 t need more than that,282
82262,2002142059,4,my own noodles with the kids they loved the textures i added twice as many vegetables and we used chicken because we had leftovers it was a huge hit the kids got up this morning and asked if there were leftovers there weren t because they wanted it for breakfast,262
34081,92701,1,sorry on a scale of 1 to 10 for flavor this rates a 1 it was absoutely bland no zest or spicey taste at all the ribs do melt right off the bone due to cook time but with no flavor at all,186
133513,2351921,5,i ve this several times now so much for the my husband and i love it served with a brown sauce that i adapted from a i found online to it vegetarian i usually end up putting in some cooked frozen peas or peas and carrots to it even yummier,239
221178,346919,5,this is the perfect soft sugar cookie all four children and my husband loved these cookies husband said they were better than the soft sugar cookies from the bakery i used 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and no almond extract will be making these again again,253
53198,159179,5,i am not a salmon love actually truth be told i hate salmon but i am implementing a healthier menu in our house and decided to give this a try boy am i glad i did this is outstanding i used low fat fat free and also omitted the cheese and broiling step absolutely dish served it with some whole wheat angel hair pasta with herbs and it was the perfect meal,356
3564,208984,5,yumm o these were i was concerned that the pumpkin flavor might beo verpowering but it wasn t i got about 3 dozen muffins but i doubt they ll last more than a day or two i ll definately this again,196
30018,1591517,5,you for this i developed an allergy to tomatoes and potatoes years ago i didn t think any version of beef stew was worth even preparing without those ingredients your is so it had the thickness warmth and comfort in a bowl that i ve been missing for years yum i left mine in the crockpot for about 11 hours i also needed to add more liquid so i poured in a box of prepared beef stock just so it loosened it up a bit,415
37336,1542289,5,this was really and cheap my boys even liked it ages 3 and 1 i plan on making this again and again,98
8782,148715,5,my dh this for a dinner party we were having wow it was we cut the cayenne in half as the kids may not have liked it and i m glad i did or it would have the gravy too hot i will definately this one again and again,213
101144,923645,5,this was however i this a bit differently i topped off the potatoes with the mash and marinara and cheese was amaaazing,119
50901,465062,5,i screwed up my first batch of the butterhorns i cut the dough the already divided into 1 4 dough into 4 quarters with a pizza cutter then i just rolled the big trianglar pieces and tried to 4 big pieces of butterhorns the result is surprisingly i think the outside of the butterhorn was only half way done but i guess since i used jam instead of egg white it is okay that it is not fully cooked i told my husband it is not quite done yet and it tastes like apple pie my husband tried and he said it tastes much better than an apple pie it is karen for the how do you pronounce this in hungarian,595
315511,294255,5,super quick and the rice turned out for my california rolls,59
255733,512696,5,i this for easter sunday and everyone loved it i couldn t find dulce de leche in the can so i used 76284 to my own very rich so you only need a little slice the textures go together too and the pie was really pretty on the table for pac spring 2009,248
72826,2000181365,5,i these last night for the first time to rave reviews i was a little sketchy about the grape jelly but i figured all these people couldn 039 t be wrong i will definitely be keeping this in my arsenal of and so so so appetizers couldn 039 t be more or,250
77316,95690,5,and perfect for a rainy day,27
176435,1069463,5,loved it as written goes with homemade breadsticks will definately again,72
14979,1797682,3,i this after i read some of the reviews i cut the milk back to 2 1 2 cups and used 2 and cut the sugar back to 1 2 cup i also used 1 whole egg and 2 yolks i also put pudding on the bottom before the bananas then the rest of the pudding it turned out real thick for me try doing that if your having trouble with the pudding being soupy,334
148068,1914273,4,very flavorful would have been better with roasted beef shank with bones i omitted the can of corn the cabbage and the salt bouillon already has lots of salt in it 1 pound of stew meat was plentiful for this,207
53832,54067,4,these are really cookies my kids loved them i didn t have any quick cooking oatmeal so i pulsed some regular oatmeal in the processor after the first batch came out of the oven the kids requested chocolate chips in them so i added mini chocolate chips to the rest of the batch,276
288518,660995,4,i followed the as stated but used 4 cups of rice instead of 1 and 5 cups of water instead of 3 the rice was wasn t over salted at all,133
66689,1094332,4,and an way to to prepare after work i did veer from and used blue cheese which was over powering today i am adding a leaf of basil proscuitto and goat cheese as the implant love the name and love the base,204
197250,176113,5,this is absolutely the best addition to any holiday meal mmmmmm,63
97838,151445,5,so flavorful and aromatic this dish twice already using olive oil instead of butter and one full teaspoon of curry powder the first time i used dijon mustard and boneless skinless thighs second time i used regular yellow mustard and bone in thighs with the skin on i mixed up the sauce ingredients and let it marinate with the chicken for about six hours both tries were however i think i preferred the second method best a definite keeper you,443
11191,927761,5,these are very i 10 quarts and added 3 tablespoons of pickling spices and also a little cayenne pepper to taste i will use ths again alot for sharing your,154

25768,684659,4,i m not a huge fan of potato salad because i am a very picky eater i this without the onions it was very the only thing i will change next time is maybe less celery seed,169
86055,437564,4,these muffins are pretty but i like them a bit sweeter so next time i ll likely add a bit more but they re healthier for the kids as is my substitutions fresh squeezed orange juice whatever pulp i could get instead of regular oj 1 2 butter 1 2 vegetable oil instead of margarine added about 1 2 cup of raisins was doubled forgot to add the vanilla that someone else recommended next time,387
57176,211331,5,beachgirl looking for a sauce i was aroused by the reviews that had been submitted you zaar so i it and was very happy with the results this will be used again and again i think i will also use this as a bbq sauce anyhow it was don,231
201465,1386868,5,i live in toronto ontario and we do not have the cheesecake in canada and i absolutely love this dish and get it every time i am in america i wanted to try and it myself and was happy to find this i it for a galentines night valentines day for all the girls it turned out it was pretty identical to the dish served in the restaurant i did add pepper salt and some garlic to the bread crumbs other then that it was perfect love it will it again for sure,452
2816,902736,5,these were n my 12 yr old son them we ve also used ham n chz,60
54225,222838,5,so much juenessa this is my 1st attempt on brownies and they re outrageously to yet treat sooo we love it so much will it again in no time,138
87629,1300912,4,they taste super straight out of the oven i haven t microwaved them yet but i m sure they ll be i also used cornbread mix instead of cornmeal and they turned out light and fluffy i think more sausage is needed i used chorizo to give the muffin more oompf my 7 year old daughter didn t think they tasted on their own but with some jam she loved them,348
117370,2001566935,5,i really don t cook but my mulberry tree is ripe with berries so what do i doooooooo i grab a bis quick and dump in the mulberries i also don t have a muffin pan so i used a glass baking dish and doubled the lots of mulberries i left out the sugar that can be added later as honey or maple syrup i don t keep sugar either looks let s see how my modification turned out,368
34185,39394,5,two a real hit with my family try this one d,44
81668,105471,5,we added mushrooms to this but otherwise as stated it was,57
226394,1816361,5,i used a 5 4 lb whole beef tenderloin and it would have served 9 10 people generously i quadrupled the marinade and doubled the rub and glaze cooked it on a big green egg seared at 600 cooked at 325 using a remote reading meat thermometer is essential to avoid having to open the grill lid too many times to test at end game this is a entree for special occasions and special friends i only raed it a 5 stars because there wasn t an option to rate it at ten stars,463
7218,6313,5,i tried this tonight and thought it waa excellent i do not have a steamer so i just cooked the asparagus in salted water for about 5 minutes then drained it and put the vinaigrette on it it cooked so fast i was glad to serve it at room temperature,247
97553,411342,5,not only was this extremely to but incredibly,45
14684,2000297659,5,i used whole wheat noodles it took a little longer to prep than the stated but it wasn 039 t hard to at all definitely use a large dish because this is a huge batch you can probably feed a minimum of a dozen people with it,222
154142,1164638,5,i have this bread several times and it has always been consistently the flavor has the tang of a sourdough and the texture of the crust is perfect slightly bubbly under the crust i use starter from king arthur flour i have to really hold off from cutting it straight from the oven yummm,286
9160,203674,5,this was when i needed something interesting that wouldn t upset my nursing baby s stomach i used 2 c rice from leftover chinese with the 4 c of whole milk and cooked it for 35 min i think i would add a 1 4 c more of sugar to have it a little sweeter also mixed in about 1 4 c dried fruit and 1 4 c sweetened coconut the last 10 minutes but everyone loved it even my 2 yr old,375
77956,42290,5,these are fabulous i substituted the pecans for the walnuts personal preference but followed all other directions as written fantastic flavor will again,152
81352,1339840,2,maybe it was because i used creole mustard instead of dijon but this didn t work out for me its a sauce i may use to drizzle onto some other salad but it didn t wilt down and embrace the cabbage like i expected maybe a lighter napa cabbage would work better with it,265
22575,429495,5,this is a dish though i modified the for my version after seaoning the breast with a creole seasoning i quickly browned the breasts in olive oil over high heat in the same pan i sauteed liced onions and and then baked it all in the oven stuff,242
55304,855713,5,we loved this soup i used a sprinkle of chili peppers instead of the cayenne and it tasted i it for a work luncheon and everyong loved it,137
280484,2081968,5,sauce is to die for had over noodles very and to,48
65330,60617,5,these came out so moist and couldn t be easier to,49
28956,837304,2,i tried this based on all the rave reviews but i was disappointed i d give it 5 stars for ease of preparation but the taste was processed almost the exact same flavor of that beef stew that comes in cans if you want a super quick beef stew without any real preparation then this is the for you i think i ll stick with my other beef stew recipes though,351
88410,2342358,5,i cook for my daughter and son in law and i gotta tell ya they are the most picky eaters in the world plus they are trying to eat healthy they both loved this dish i think they ate on it for three nights straight very moist and,227

499880,1800179324,4,really enjoyed this was difficult to get the kids to try it because it 039 s not pretty but once they got passed it the loved it,128
43703,2002283818,3,for some reason i think there s either too much butter or not enough sugar yes it fudge however it was more like a truffle type of fudge the kind you roll into balls or something like that it wasn t the firm piece of fudge i another batch again and added more sugar and it s more of the consistency of fudge i like i added a whole additional cup of sugar maybe even a little more until it was the texture and firmness i m accustomed to seeing in fudge otherwise it tasted really,478
132488,1119670,5,this is the best boterkoek i was so excited to find it on the site it turns out perfectly every time i added it to my christmas baking and put green and red sugar crystals on top it turned out very pretty and festive you so much for a,234
36513,46022,5,these really taste like oreos for the filling if you find them clumping take liberty to add more water bit by bit and stirring till you get a filling consistency,161
17944,91867,5,these cookies were wonderful i halved the and wound up with 3 dozen cookies i also rolled the cookie dough ball in extra sugar before baking they were very you for sharing,171
156318,2002782509,5,i love this i ve it a bunch of times but this last time i took out a boneless chicken breast cut it into cubes and sauted it in sesame oil and when it was just about done i poured a little teriyaki sauce on it and then mixed it with the rice it was it was a complete meal,271
130297,148894,5,this sauce was a big hit it s and to for sharing the,52
342833,390431,5,this is without a doubt the best b w ever i had my doubts since it didn t include pate which i don t really like anyway but the mushroom pate is over the top just be aware that the prep and cooking times in the don t include cooling times for the pate or the filets which is vital deinemuse for sharing this,307
87698,1666630,5,i ve been making roast for years mostly in the crock pot but this was the tastiest moistest roast i ve ever the whole family loved it instead of browning in the oven i browned it in my cast iron skillet on the stove top first then browned the onions before adding low sodium beef stock instead of water i also added low sodium brown gravy mix then i put it all together and cooked for the time given the brown sugar was the perfect addition for the chuck roast mercy,466
12431,221351,5,fast and low in calories especially if you use sweetener to replace sugar what else could anyone want love it,109
285714,2001904013,4,basic cabbage to cook ans add your own touches if you want tasted and to,72
304516,2002713307,5,we just this and it turned out better than we expected i was working on the computer so my daughter and son finished it my daughter had read all the reviews before we started we doubled everything to 2 pies we sat our eggs out for 2 hours as suggested and softened our butter for 30 minutes on the countertop my daughter sure to beat the eggs for 3 minutes until they were very foamy then they added in the ingredients slowly in the following order flour brown sugar white sugar and then butter mixing the whole time with the electric mixer the chocolate chips were folded in last using a spatula we used the semi sweet nestle morsels and did not coat them in flour as someone had suggested we liked the 3 layers that were in this pie crust sugar flour and chocolate we did not want the morsels to be evenly distributed throughout we used land o lakes butter don t use margarine none of us are fans of nuts so we did not add any kind of nuts to our pies our pies cooked for exactly 60 minutes we put a sharp knife in when done and it had a little liquid on it it should not be expected to come out clean you don t want it too dry you have melted chocolate in it but we took them out and let them set for 4 hours before cutting them we did not put anything on the top of the pies but served them with ice cream the pieces of pie came out in tact and very solid it was we wrapped the leftovers in tinfoil and stored it on the counter it was the next day heated for 10 seconds in the microwave some family members liked it room temperature this is a we hope we help someone else when making this dessert to those reviews that helped us,1632
141973,321965,5,oh these are so definately will be making these again and again,63
117780,66036,5,so much better than the mushroom soup dry onion soup pot roast that i ve been making for years this seems healthier and has become our new favorite i would give it 10 stars if i could,183
28768,309368,5,i this on valentine s day as a special treat wow it was i followed the exactly as written for the,97
31516,448004,4,like others my rice was not cooked during the process i even soaked the rice for 10 minutes next time i will cook the rice and it a little bit shorter cooking time in the oven i definitely liked this dish and will it again,222
97445,336550,5,i added some kidney beans for protien and some black olives and sauted zuchinni excellent a keeper,98
73166,1267163,5,this is a and chili we it just as the says and agree it s on the sweet side might cut back on the brown sugar next time and throw in some chili powder also agree with other reviewers that it tastes better the next day a chili,225
58393,481845,5,absolutely i didn t change a thing and everyone loved it,56
182631,343922,4,i absolutely love this the flavor of the muffin is a bit on the bland side but with the chocolate chips added it s perfect i do not have any muffin tins at this time i threw ours away before our last move since they were getting yucky so i just it in an 8 x 8 pan turned out so i immediately a second batch after finishing off the first one the thing was that a small bit would cure my sweet tooth after a meal and it was practically guilt free since it is so healthy i would recommend to never leave out the chocolate chips unless you really hate chocolate it adds a dimension to this muffin the only thing i would definitely change after making this many times is to add 1 teaspoon of salt it changes the flavor for the better quite dramatically i don t like it nearly as much without the salt you so much for this,816
53216,407677,5,mirj i this for erev shavuot because i had to work that day and knew i would have very little time to dinner what can i say it s so incredibly and my husband loved it i loved it too he loved it so much he wanted it again thursday the only thing i did differently was crushing the cornflakes for the topping we were going away for the weekend so i froze the remainder we had it today for lunch when we got home it freezes and reheats fabulously my husband has asked me to this on a regular basis it is so you for yet another wonderful since i first reviewed this i have this with dried apricots which i snipped up into raisin sized pieces it was wonderful and my friend tried it using drained diced canned apricots she loves it so much she says she will never noodle kugel any other way again neither will i i think this is so versatile it could be used with almost any fruit yummmmmmmmmm,887
210811,2002856442,5,these were very crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside,62
76517,270318,5,i really liked this i double servings intending to freeze the rest but ended up finishing them in one meal i had a little trouble getting the chips to stick to the chicken i used skinless thigh and added a little flour which didn t really seem to help i used a cheap brand of potato chips sour cream and onion and omitted the butter but overall this is a really and dish that i ll definitely do again,400
107864,66983,5,i this as a gift for an ailing neighbor she was tickled and called me at work last night to let me know that this was excellent i m posting my review vicariously through her hope that is okay paula,197

198485,2001189279,5,very i didn t have any manwich so i decided to my own here i just didn t have tomato sauce so i used marinara sauce instead it turned out to be a choice despite my reservations then to this i just used chopped onion chopped small sweet red pepper a bit of water and a little red wine vinegar just sure you saute the veges with the beef when it has browned before you add the wet ingredients,390
265441,238853,5,this was absolutely fantastic my two step sons 7 and 11 both loved it and my husband thought it was as well always to find something that pleases everyone it was too weeknight vegetarian meal,191

185202,1528603,5,very everyone loved it i adjusted the receipe somewhat i did not usethe gravy itself in the meatloaf just on the side with the mashed i instead used about a 1 4 cup of heinz 57 steak sauce to give it a bit more zing and keep it moist i also used the same measurements to 8 small individual meatloaves and it took 2 packages of crescent rolls to fully cover each but they were really very very,392

221942,359707,4,way to use leftover rice from christmas dinner i actually used 2 day old rice from a chinese place nearby it worked wonders but i think it was a bit too sweet with 1 2 cup of sugar next time i ll use 1 4 cup and a binch more i also left out the nutmeg and vanilla by choice for the,281

120473,831580,4,this is a somewhat familiar kind of and pretty but the biscuit and sesame seed topping has a vaguely fancy feel it really did kind of taste like sloppy joes on a sesame seed bun albeit with the addition of the cheese i this exactly as written using mostly 85 grond beef and a little 93 i had on hand and the cheddar was mild not sharp,334

212589,1801585385,5,i 039 m going to try this tonight i was trying to replicate the quot old quot shoney 039 s quot house quot salad dressing they stopped having it in about 1997 and changed over to kraft salad dressings the company that the former salad dressings was at one time owned by shoney 039 s then sold off and then folded i hope this one taste like my old favorite,355

58813,2264142,5,love this i changed up the spinach salad with pinenuts sweetened cranberries feta with the spinach lots more than indicated works golden raisins and don t forget the sun dried tomatoes slice or chop then you need something acidic to balance also for the meat eaters offer cooked chicken chunks on the side,305

200864,1360982,5,i substituted chicken for the pork and it turned out wonderful i didn t add as much wine as called for personal preference but the taste was still excellent it may not be traditional but in today s life you take the shortcuts where you can i don t think it affected the flavor using said shortcuts my grandsons loved it for posting,331
75658,2001300190,5,i don t know what the panic is all about i just these cookies with her and it rocked i used coconut oil as a substitute for shortening and it was i have to say try that and see what happens and healthier,203
28916,59199,3,i these w the changes that you the only difference was that i used vanilla ff yogart and flavored oatmeal banana bread flavor they turned out tasteing okay my husband seemed to like them more than me i think i like things a tad bit sweeter i also added raisins to some of the muffins which i think inhanced the flavor,317
155715,1417877,5,just these for my step daughters bday party tomorrow and very you for posting this,82
48331,138162,5,yum o this was the best caramel corn this was my first time making it and i followed the as written and it turned out i 2 batches tonight i loved the texture it s light airy the next time i it i will be adding some nuts for sharing a,233
383175,1803638965,4,this is a i added some mushrooms as well,40
95988,115053,3,ok i really wanted to love these but was disappointed it could have been me i followed directions exactly except for the tortillas couldn t find sun dried tomato so i used spinach tortillas also i substituted green olives for black just because of preference i tried this both grilled in the george forman and cold i felt the cream cheese and the mozz cheese was just too much cheese for me i absolutely love the idea but maybe i need to try skipping the cream cheese or something anyway i ll keep trying,504
175799,324310,5,a real husband pleaser so pretty and fresh i reduced the olive oil in the dressing to only 1 tablespoon to cut a few calories the lemon and mustard dressing contrasted with the sweetness of the corn and just my tastebuds tingle so,230
449124,2442773,5,this tonight although i was short on time got impatient as i always do with bread that i had not let it double in size and yet it turned out perfectly done brushed garlic butter after 20 minutes in the oven at 380 and put it to broil for 1 minute my family was halfway through spaghetti dinner but dug into the bread and had seconds of the spag to go with it p according to them this is better than any bread we ve bought will have this again for sure,451
53809,817360,5,flavorful wings substituted crushed pineapple for chunks for superbowl party everyone raved about how they were,111
28648,607820,5,this is the best i loved making omelets like this my son and husband were very impressed used the ham and cheddar but the options are endless you for a technique,161
183642,214690,5,i too deviated from the and used regular mustard also eliminated the chili pepper flakes so all could enjoy in the household it was a bit too salty for me and i love salt maybe 1 2 tsp would be sufficient will definately again for the,234
191110,738763,5,potatoes they fried up and crispy and the lemon added such flavor we had these with some pan seared trout,105
269336,640173,5,cookie dog i and my friends at work really loved this i cut out a lot of the calories by using turkey sausage and egg beaters i also used whole wheat bread toasted instead of french bread it was zippy and so p s cute dog,220
21761,1463003,5,i this as a side to our beef tenderloin roast at christmas dinner my sons and husband loved this i added a handful of chopped pancetta when i covered this was and,162
171354,401904,2,i m sorry to say i didn t like this much it was too salty for me and not the oriental flavor i would look for i will try it again with some changes less soya sauce fresh garlic and some ginger maybe i love my crock pot so will review again with the changes,256
531455,2001516730,5,my grandson only eats bologna he loves these with that meat dry the pickle slices you can substitute thin sliced cheese of your choice i use sargento thin sliced swiss or provolone,180
29998,21274,5,so much for posting this it s wonderful because the sauce doesn t absorb into the potatoes even after a day of setting in the fridge i m going to use this sauce for macaroni salad as well what a you very much,208
327346,1393336,2,this is the closest version to rt if you don t have time for the other the other one does have far more ingredients and spices and fresh ingredients so it tastes almost exact but if you dont have the time do it this way but it really is better with the other version been making it the longer way since 2000 and the velveeta is only gooey if you dont follow the directions,372
39331,30503,5,an sauce to serve with any meat i had it with a peppercorn crusted roast,72
106145,254070,5,oh my gosh i these and it was sensational all rolled into one elegant dinner the only change that i was with the sauce i used 1 2 milk and 1 2 cream the crepes were to and went extremely well with the chicken i am having card club tonight and they are going to be served this elegant meal kelbel,295
65094,2801751,5,these are really second time around i added some chillies and a few fried onions,80
194400,850034,5,i was a complete skeptic i thought this is too to actually be but i was wrong these are as another reviewer noted the mayo keeps the chicken exceptionally moist which is difficult to do when using tenders because they re so thin so take a couple of minutes truly and whip up a batch you won t be sorry,301
259572,844509,5,while visiting my mother in law went out to dinner with her and her friends they me try she crab soup because they love it my mother in law tells her friends that if anyone can it mo can no pressure i quickly found this and when she came up to see us i it for the first time she was amazed because she liked this better because of the lumps of crab for a,354
56804,29404,5,fantastic we love monte crito s so we were really looking forward to trying this i halved the and used 8x8 pan worked perfectly only change is instead of the strawberries we used raspberry preserves like we do with the sammies sweet tart compliment even tho i think there was a little more prep work than actual sammies this seemed so much easier you so much for this alternative,379
274402,185726,5,oh my goodness this has got to be the best sandwich i have ever had the combination of everything is perfect my husband insisted i him a 2nd sandwich and kept repeating oh this is sooo it was my first time eating anything with sauerkraut and i was amazed at how perfectly all the ingredients blended together this will be a regular in our house now many for posting,365
112324,592373,5,fantastic this came out perfectly was a big hit w everyone the cake was really rich decadent the frosting is creamy to whip up i love the ease results of this,158
137530,1992144,5,this was a my husband and son both loved it,43
63071,2000001876,5,so to and the family loved this i added 2 teaspoons of vanilla to the mix but other than that i left it as written we have a new waffle in the house,148
223692,174090,5,these were my chicken breasts were so fat that instead of pounding the chicken flat i cut a slit on the side and poked the stuffing in that way they came out juicy and flavorful next time i ll double the sauce and the stuffing or try to find smaller chicken breasts,265
10125,998171,5,when i had a lot of friends over and they vanished so fast it was crazy love how soft and fluffy they come out this is now my go to for chocolate chip cookies,158
97213,859301,5,i didn t refrigerate i just let it sit in the sauce pan for about a half hour or so i poured it directly on my cake and it s a beautiful consistency so much for sharing this,173
109925,674979,1,i didn t care for this one either i only marinated it for about 6 or 7 hours and the taste of the orange soda was still too strong,130
29329,601277,5,these were the only change i was to add salami instead of the chicken,69
132764,247194,5,this was outstanding i used a clove of garlic and 1 8 cup of grated red onion instead of the garlic and onion powders also added a small handful 1 8 c of craisins and 1 4 slivered almonds wow also used leftover dressing for a chicken romaine salad it was terrific mama,268
261024,957804,4,very and quick i found it a little too sweet and thick but once i doubled the milk and added a splash of almond extract it was perfect this will be the i use for all of my cakes and brownies now its just too,207
10381,1774525,5,and very to i them for christmas morning brunch and everyone loved them,71
35966,591035,2,these are a fine if you re allergic to eggs but i m not and i miss them eggs and a little butter in the batter would a better texture they re kind of chalky and 425 for 15 minutes is way too long i should have known better to check on them earlier 10 minutes in and they were burned on the bottom even on the top shelf in the oven i do enjoy the sugar zest top,360
209699,2731741,5,i added bay leaves and a pinch of rosemary it tasted,52
217383,512501,5,perfect taste it shows that you have perfected each ingredient amount for sharing it,84
43267,98590,5,these were really i had a craving for sweet potatoes late one night and came on zaar looking for recipes and found this one i m glad i did it was really and i did exactly what the said but found them a little too thin for my taste i ll lessen the milk next time and maybe add a little of cinnamon for a little flavor kick i ll definitely these again s a keeper for sharing,372
44048,168423,5,the best will treasure this,27
256832,1656858,5,my wife and i really enjoyed this dip i didn 039 t have the del monte tomatoes so i used plain diced tomatoes and added a teaspoon of oregano basil and crushed garlic,166
11470,71498,4,the whole family really enjoyed this one regular chicken cordon blue s are one of their very favoriates but this was a lot less expensive and filled their tummies up a lot more definitely a keeper,196
181385,70082,3,i thought they need salt maybe 1 4 tsp or so otherwise they were pretty i liked all the different things in them but without salt they taste bland and i threw out most of the batch i ll try them again though anyway,214
429241,1355867,5,this was fabulous one of the most flavorful i ve found on this site i substituted the canned tomatoes with fresh chopped i also added 8 oz tomato sauce and simmered it on low for a long time until eggplant soft my preferences the flavors were divine i served as side dish to chicken masala and served with naan,310
23052,330754,5,i knew absoluting nothing about enchiladas i m a beginner and this it so and it tasted so i took the advice of another on this and use rotisseri chicken pre and doubled the cheese cheese lover i definitely plan on making this at least once a week makes for left overs too,271
4957,493276,5,this is and this has become something my fiance regularly requests i serve it with homemade salsa and it s a hit every time,123
312790,886427,5,i m not the best at making anything but this was so and so quick everyone loved it,82
498,145599,4,these were very to the dough was a bit sticky though had to add more flour i will definitely these again tastes with cheese,123
48824,229375,5,this was an will be making all my fillet and steak fish this way on the grill or stove for a,92
134397,334054,5,very and to adjust to your own taste and is a hit with most people who usually don t like to try new things,107
10837,1978793,4,very very sauce i give it 4 stars because i highly recommend blanching the tomatoes and removing the skins before dicing them it makes for a nicer textured sauce without the skins i used dried parsley instead of fresh and turned out but the fresh basil is a must,262
156148,697860,5,an i had been looking for this since my boyfriend said he use to eat it all the time i could not find it anywhere i did increase the olive oil to 3 4 a cup so that we could have more dipping sauce for the bread for posting this,227
87782,693064,5,i this a few times already always spasibo,41
228259,839166,5,so i this for dinner and the first pan was gone before dinner was even half way over i used part whole wheat and part white it turned out,137
359553,1086564,5,we loved it even my picky daughter loved it it helps that her fav is top ramen but she had two helpings it was i just used left over chicken from a baked chicken and added the veggies quick and really tasting,208
74259,110034,4,it tasted pretty and was to put together but the next time i will cut the barley way back since it was very thick and overwhelmed the pea flavor,144
48172,412232,5,absolutely wonderful pie this for easter and it was a hit thought it was better the next day i ll it the day before i plan to use it next time you,146
90874,87144,5,followed directions to the letter and man was this it reminded me of potato skins picky dd ate two helpings for the and the picture,131
129377,2503874,4,set up beautifully once it was completely cool i added a sprinkle of nutmeg on top and loved the added flavor,109
82925,587527,5,just like the apple crisp my mom growing up served hot with with some whipped cream on top i used a lot more cinnamon than the calls for i sprinkled some on the apples before covering with teh topping plus i tripled at least the amount in the topping itself yum,261
97246,276833,5,this was my first attempt at making a jelly this was a lot easier than i thought it would be and the jelly came out i didn t change a thing except i increased the amount of chili for posting,190
356268,1983600,5,this is perfect the only thing i did differently is i trimmed the peel off the lemon and finely julienned it into the marmalade and juiced the lemon from there to scorch so watch out taste is spectacular,203
19921,1420506,5,super and a twist on the usual for posting this came in really handy when i needed a sauce for over chicken and mashed and didn t have much available,149
123678,191894,4,these had excellant flavor but they were too moist to be eaten with your fingers next time i will try adding more oats and less milk i am watching my dad lick his fingers from trying to pick one up right now i was looking for cow patty cookies and someone put this in my post so i tried it i will try it again but want something a little firmer that holds its shape instead of a gooey mess,389
108893,490713,5,i have this twice already both times using a slow cooker cos i like the fact that i can dump everything into the pot and forget about it for the next few hours the first time i this i added 3 cups water to the pot i didnt sear the meat and as a result i ended up with alot of sauce i had to transfer all the contents to a wok and simmer until the sauce reduces it was the 1st time the 2nd time i this i reduced the water to 1 cup only on a whim i boiled some spaghetti to go with the stew and it became a version of a beef noodle and quick i did increase the fish sauce and brown sugar to compensate for a more watery stew for sharing,634
89204,1725932,5,we have eaten this over mexican rice as a stuffing for burrito shells as a dip i shredded the chicken when it was done and mixed everything together with tortilla chips and as a casserole it is so and so and i love that it can be used so many ways,247
28165,138686,5,i cut the in half but still used the whole can of tomatoes i used enough minor s chicken base to 1 cup of broth but only used 2 oz of water since i was adding the whole can of tomatoes i had italian hot sausage on hand so i used that no shrimp in the freezer but i had some imitation crab meat so i used it hey don t judge if you don t expect it to taste like crab then it s ok otherwise i followed the and it was i ll this again maybe with some shrimp and andouille next time for sharing,488
37768,1681562,5,i have access to a mercado hispanic market use queso fresco cheese and it will turn out wonderful,97
30399,98761,5,these were very i followed the instructions exactly but they were not done i gave them an extra 15 minutes or so and still not quite done my husband loved them anyway my tooth just broke in half while i was eating them no fault of the so i didn t get to finish mine but they were very will definitely again,306
67470,37640,5,i followed the instructions exactly and it turned out crisp and tender lt br gt update 1 23 14 this has effectively become my quot standard quot treatment for poultry even turkey it pops out a tender and juicy bird almost every time i don 039 t know how many times i 039 ve reprinted and hand copied this but after doing it yet again it seemed wrong to not acknowledge what a this is and how much i 039 ve used it,413
38733,7802,4,very sandwich because vidalias aren t available this time of year i used what was available to take some of the bite out of the onion i roasted it for a few minutes i then put the onion and pepper on bread and prepared it as i would a grilled cheese it was quite and went well with your creamy cheese bowl for posting,317
77023,168220,5,this was my dh usually rates any chicken dish so so but he really enjoyed this i used regular sour cream and regular chicken soup because that is what i had on hand served with a rice pilaf and quick too this is definitely a keeper,231
305024,355885,5,this was and so healthy i got my grains some iron omega 3s and protien all in one quick breakfast the only thing i didnt use was craisins as i didn t have any and i dont really like them anyway,193
28648,367916,5,we had this for breakfast christmas morning it was very filling and a big hit with the family,93
73440,719289,5,my husband loved this we got some beer for christmas that we didn t enjoy drinking but it some bread,100
46479,66983,5,i love this i have started using this instead of buying store bread my kids both love it and so does my picky husband i use the honey version as i dont like the taste of molasses i recommend it for anyone with a bread machine they dont use this will also scale down to a one pound loaf and turns out just right,310
17263,1802435481,4,i messed with this just a bit i just wanted to try it so i only used 1 block of cream cheese 1 tsp of vanilla i only use watkins if your deserts taste quot off quot blame cheap vanilla and 1 3 tsp of almond flavor watkins brand also i like eggs so i thought quot what the heck quot and i put two in 8 packets of splenda lt br gt lt br gt i think it tastes for what it is but get it cold,386
230509,2001236401,3,unfortunately i found this pretty bland i used a for self rising flour add 1 tsp baking powder and 1 4 tsp salt for every 3 4 cup of flour breyer s chocolate hazelnut gelato and added a bit of almond extract tasted like a bland vaguely ice cream flavored loaf of bread kind of like a very basic bread from bisquick i also needed to add about 1 4 cup of milk to it a bread like batter i even spooned and levelled my flour as you re supposed to do when baking rather than just dipping the cup into the bag next time i would probably add a couple tablespoons of butter and sugar and maybe a handful of chocolate chips that being said it is a pretty efficient way to use up a flavor of ice cream you don t really care for as it just makes it taste like bland bread instead,768
84030,288351,5,this is outstanding and i this according to the using all optional ingredients except tortilla chips i serve it wrapped in tortillas however it never lasts long enough to be in my oamc cookbook lol tish,202
236206,1725615,4,this was over a bed of boiled white rice added a little salt to liven things up and it was just what i was craving i will be making this again and again,152
15348,823189,5,wonderful thex tasted just like i remember them from home i also like the filling as a main dish with some salad you for posting,128
193055,515689,5,i left the beans out of the to save calories still gorgeous,59
241141,724593,5,loved these debber i love to have pickles on hand to have along with soup and sandwiches at lunch time the pickles are and crunchy too,134
486261,2443409,5,i now have a new favorite this meets all my needs when i add a salad,68
77978,2000552991,5,i have to admit this was my first time trying to a coconut cream pie it 039 s thanksgiving and my husband isn 039 t a fan of pumpkin pie so as per his request i decided to try coconut cream i follows the instructions just as they are using coconut milk the filling is sooo i wasn 039 t sure on the timing for cooking the filling so i simply cooked it until it was and thick it only took about 7 minutes set a bit lower than medium heat 4 instead of 5 on my dial it set perfectly and tastes so glad i found this and to everyone saying it was runny my suspicion is you didn 039 t allow it took cook long enough the times are guidelines only once it starts gently bubbling don 039 t stop whisking or it will stick to the bottom it only takes a couple mins 1 2 for it to start getting thick don 039 t give up on this try again and cook it until it 039 s thick in the pot don 039 t time for 10 mins that could be too long or not long enough depending on your stove you won 039 t be disappointed it 039 s perfect,1006
44321,2000136954,5,weeknight dinner the family liked i was out of rice used angel hair pasta only a sprinkle of red pepper flakes kids don 039 t like it spicy added 3 cloves of garlic as chicken finished browning couple of dashes of sesame oil near the end a little orange zest i can see this easily modified by what is on hand and used in regular rotation,337
204646,45027729,4,sounds although i would replace cucumber which i hate lol with chopped pickles the only reason i 039 m not making this is because i have no idea how to convert grams to normal measurements hey guys why not give us the option,224
63893,177688,5,this was surprisingly it was quick and and a hit with the kids i doubled it used ground beef instead of flank steak and served on top of jasmine rice,149
372876,869532,5,for another way to sweet potatoes i ll this again for zwt5,58
10348,344022,5,these bbq cups are now a standard party favorite they are so to and to eat christine,84
345041,362184,4,this for christmas gathering to go along with seafood gumbo thought that next to the delish gumbo a salad of any kind would not turn any heads but received quite a few compliments forgot to add in the swiss cheese so i imagine it is even better with that also only ended up topping with about half the dressing for the idea i am always looking for new ways to jazz up the healthier sides especially salads,405
106321,1154995,5,very authenic this is my favorite mexican these turned out wonderfully you them with sauce old school like my family who is from sinaloa does yeah i have tried to them like my grandma but she doesnt remember all of the steps because of her age i was very happy how everything was a million for the,297
50018,106506,5,we used margarine instead of butter and you absolutely can t tell this is vegan i poured a little madeira over the mushrooms and let them cook until nicely browned it adds a flavor we ve been hunting for a meatless dairy free spread and this is it,247
182489,406587,3,i like this because it is to and on pasta,41
518182,1803077446,5,here i go again loving here i go again eating well,50
130564,581376,5,my daughters 10 and loves to cook we these together very and everybody loved them always looking for something new and different and these were perfect,151
222188,2002236863,5,i m planning to these for two birthday cakes i am so excited to try this because it s the highest rated and i was trying to find a buttercream for both chocolate cakes i m planning to this into a cookies and cream frosting using mini oreos i am just wondering how i can incorporate the cream into this and if it ll taste,320
300192,685371,4,i am always looking for different recipes using canned salmon and i came across this one and had to give it a try i thought it was really i sprinkled some crushed red pepper on the patties as i fried them too for an even bigger kick my dh even liked them and he doesn t like salmon too much at all for a,303
15990,25711,5,my 16 yr old son cooks the family dinner once a week this was for him to and was a hit was completely gone by the next day i think he ll be wanting to this dish again soon,171
81870,2175491,5,wow i too grew up in rhode island and remember watching my grandmother use the morning s leftover coffee for my grandfather s favorite coffee jello lunchtime dessert he would eat a big bowl with a splash of cream,212
167202,416537,5,this was i think next time i ll add seasonings to add some flavor maybe garlic it was to throw together my husband said i didn t think i liked chicken pot pie but this is,170
96563,209318,4,this was really i think marinating the tofu would ve been but it was still without it really did taste like something you would get at a chinese restaurant i added a bit of garlic chili paste at the end because i like it spicy for the,234
25806,400738,5,just what i was looking for and so too i followed the except i used a large can of tomato sauce instead of the can of tomatoes since my kids don t like the chunks of tomato in their stew i also added some orzo pasta at the end of cooking i served this with southern cornbread and my kids loved it,296
424392,2523094,2,idea i really wanted to like this but it didn t work for me i pretty brownies using applesauce black beans a few years back really liked them i thought they were quite was craving them but i can t find the i thought this might be similar gave it a go sadly it doesn t taste the same or have the same texture the batter did taste pretty mixed up in the bowl and i got real excited to try them but after baking it was a really weird consistency and all i tasted was banana well more like mushy banana with a dash of chocolate so i think the ratios were off it needed more cocoa and probably more oats or some flax seed added in to it more solid more like a brownie or cookie to get rid of that mushiness also i would probably skip the banana just use applesauce which always seems to work well as an oil substitute when baking applesauce has a very neutral flavor won t overpower the other flavors like the banana did after trying it fresh out of the oven i tried it cold from the fridge frozen and reheated in the micro with cocoa powder on top i think cold is best but i was still wasn t thrilled there is too much moisture in this to freeze it it turned into a brown block of ice and when hot it gets even more banana ish mushy the dusting of cocoa on top didn t do anything to help,1283
33671,364826,5,i m not a huge fan of chicken but this was wonderful i didn t have white pepper so i used a bit more black and it was still just fine and i added a tad more garlic powder so much for sharing i will be adding this to my list of dinners for sure,243
187473,105780,5,we had this for supper and a treat it is lenten meal hubby really enjoyed it,76
27208,572039,4,the gravy this makes is wonderful i added carrots and onions and that along with the gravy were my favorite part i served it with mashed potatoes i it with a chuck roast and i don t think there was enough marbling for it to get as tender as i would ve liked so i m going to use a fattier roast next time i m really looking forward to making this again,351
76025,616588,5,and so well the spreading of the marshmallow creme was somewhat difficult but i think it has more to say about the baker than the no nuts but still the same,156
39087,1604065,5,we all loved it,15
23821,414776,5,we ve been making these for years nothing better or easier,58
369576,171683,4,five stars on ease of cooking i was looking for something i could set forget and this fit the bill i don t have the greatest luck with the slow cooker though so my expectations were low i didn t have juniper berries so i looked on line for substitutes and one suggestion was rosemary how can you go wrong with rosemary and lamb also i didn t have zinfandel i had a red blend of cab merlot and zin menage a trois otherwise i followed the exactly had a 2 5lb blol etc mine was done after 6 hours i turned it off until dinner time then set it back to low the sauce was very greasy i had to degrease before using it i found the lamb on itself to be very tender but not very flavorful it definitely needed the sauce on it the sauce was very thin i think if i it again i ll thicken for more of a gravy consistency i would definitely it again for a non grill option for blol,867
95878,186123,5,i these as my treat for this weekend yum yum yum if you love lemon these will be right down your alley i prepared exactly as shown with my only substitution being regular cream cheese frosting not whipped they had wonderful lemon flavor and were incredibly moist i will definitely be making these again slappy,309
32412,71537,5,flavor i added a packet of chicken taco seasoning to spice it up a bit too,74
19135,2238568,5,this was absolutely ingredient amounts were spot on this was very to it is now a part of my permanent cookbook so much for sharing,130
94600,423778,3,i thought this was but not fantastic i was hoping for a little sweeter sauce and felt like the vinegar and soup overpowered the honey peach conbination,151
200843,418915,5,superb cookies i had received a package of cinnamon baking chips from my sister in law so i searched for a that used them and found this the cookies were crispy on the edges but very soft and chewy inside which is just the way we like them,239
18923,42595,5,tried your but to it more authentic replace dijon mustard with dry english mustard then you have the real thing sargie,118
19282,686329,5,incredible i them for my vegan son s birthday and took them to his army base he loved them i substituted vegetable shortening for the oil put them in a muffin tin and cooked them for only 22 minutes and they were so much for sharing them,237
142850,600020,1,i was very disappointed in this i find it difficult to use recipes that don t give details such as how hot to turn the temperature to or how long steps might take so i my best guess based on other recipes i looked at and still this was a disaster the sauce lacked flavor even after i added salt pepper and cumin the stuffed chilies weren t very interesting and didn t hold up especially well when handled yuck was just a really terrible dinner i ll be posting about my experience with this on my blog www adventuroustastes blogspot com,535
28376,336177,2,this was ok but i really think 15 mins is too long we have a fairly low wattage microwave and i wish i d taken it out of the microwave at about 12 mins because it ended up over cooked and a bit too dense for my liking,217
340942,1021308,3,i have been making these kind of sausage balls for years i find that the best ratio is 2c baking mix 1 package shredded cheese 1 lb sausage,139
89204,1009684,5,it is so and my husband and kid loved it,40
51537,1173385,5,i love the fact that this wasn t terribly high in fat my husbadn said he loved the crust and that the pie i was my best yet so it s a keeper,140
42833,72179,5,i was looking for a salt free seasoning to replace the one i used to all the time before i lost my recipes due to a house fire this one was the closest that i could find i knew that my had thyme and i didn t remember it containing coriander so i substituted thyme for the coriander i also left out the nutmeg and increased the paprika you for posting,350
12522,103631,5,ok i read all the reviews here s what i did i used 6 chicken tenderloins didn t scrape off any sour cream when i dredged them my crumb mixture was 1 1 2 sleeves of ritz crackers 1 2 cup parm 1 tsp tarragon three pinches of white pepper i melted 1 stick of margarine used about 4 tbls on the bottom of the dish then the dredged chick sprinkled the rest of the bread crumbs on top followed by almost all of the rest of the melted butter i used the leftover melted butter for my green beans no potato so i wasn t over saturated fatting us you don t miss it with the bread crumb mixture then spinkled garlic powder over that baked for 50 mins oh my god this was simply who knew that chicken could cut like butter the flavor was just perfect my kids 11 16yrs want to know why there isn t more gotta go makin another batch and printing this out for all my friends to try,864
333380,1673611,5,really i this for a casual dinner party and everyone loved it with a salad on the side it served six adults a five year old and a two year old with just a little leftover i think everyone was too polite to finish off the dish the only change we to the was to forgo the cheese only because i didn t realize that we were out of it until it was too late for sharing a,364
189150,159559,5,this exactly as written and the family inhaled them muffins zee rn,66
152594,1692715,4,flavour and wonderful light texture perhaps a little dry next time i might use more pears omitted the pecans and mixed a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar into the oatmeal for the topping,190
64015,356713,5,worked perfect loved that it dried fast,39
334500,2566210,5,what a use for leftovers turkey i tripled the curry and used sweet potatoes i love the congo of sweet and spicy,111
135930,2001982944,4,i just these i only used 1 tablespoon of sugar super turned out firm biscuits that would be ideal for gravy i just had one with butter and strawberry jam it was but it was a little crumbly when cut if you just want a hearty biscuit to go with dinner i d recommend these i will be making them again,297
16216,256098,3,i this cake for a birthday party everyone said the taste was but the texture was heavy and dense cornbread texture was right on only more moist then cornbread also the batter does not rise hardly any during baking so i was safe filling the pan full i will hang on to the won t be the first i grab it did taste tho,313
42609,43846,5,i this for thanksgiving and it was a hit i used the light n healthly oj and splenda instead of sugar you for the,112
43394,49856,5,inez i doubled this and did adapt this to the items i had on hand 2 cooked frozen turkey loaves with gravy i added the leftover gravy to the cream of mushroom soup and a blend of frozen vegetables broccoli cauliflower carrots i also used fresh lemon thyme and parsley wonderful flavor instead of rolling out the crust i dropped it in pieces by hand across the top to create a crispy topping it worked this came out so that my 8 year old son who is picky about casseroles and cheese asked for a third helping this gets my highest rating so much,543
57919,34025,5,light quick and very for submitting,35
39911,296546,5,very i overcooked it just slightly but it was still really i did add a little fresh minced garlic and broil in the oven the trick is cutting it into very thin slices and then pouring the juices on top yum,204
164706,1945966,5,wow i was amazed at how this is just like the chinese restraunt i mean pretty much identical especially the crunchiness of the chicken that slurry is a trip i mean is it a solid a liquid i dunno but it works somehow get some sticky rice and this general tsos a for this,269
141429,260200,5,you i lost my mom s and these turned out just the way i remembered them she used to them every year for my birthday and i haven t had any in years tip by the way to wet your hands we always used a ton of shortening to keep our hands from sticking to the balls,259
115370,582946,5,i this for two but holy cow it was rich there s enough sweet rich sexiness here to easily serve 4 but that might compromise the sexy factor depending on what you like the only thing my blender did in this was get dirty after realizing that blending was not going to occur in step 4 i poured everything back into a bowl and used my electric mixers instead as well as for any whisking step and everything worked out delightfully i will this again and again and again,464
327922,526840,4,first try baking soda was too much for my taste second try i 1 2 original and reduced baking soda by 1 2 the original i added 1 4 tsp cinnamon and 1 2 tsp vanilla and 1 4 to 1 2 cups blueberries,194
49583,50643,5,excellent cabbage dish my family has mixed feelings about cabbage half like it the other half hate it since i love it and do all the cooking i decided to this dish very rich creamy and cheesy i also liked the herbed bread crumb topping even my cabbage haters couldn t fuss they thought it was too nurse di,305
45633,453872,4,super i also added a bit of nutmeg and some dried lemon and orange rind to give it a bit more flavor,100
309848,1348758,3,update 8 1 14 i tried this again but this time using the bette hagman gf all purpose mix i did add 3 4 tsp xanthan gum and since i am not dairy free i used a cup of milk i did reduce the soda to 1 2 teaspoon and used 1 2 tsp of salt i also used 1 tablespoon of vanilla the cake came out i used bob red mills rice flour so i let the batter sit for 30 minutes before i baked it to be sure it did not come out grainy and it did not i left the rating as original because it did need the change in soda and vanilla and i think the milk proteins might have it come out higher too i could be wrong lt br gt 7 24 14this did not come out well for me maybe it was the mix i used it was a homemade mix that took brown rice tapioca and sweet rice flour it looked in the oven and rose beautifully but when i took it out it was gelatinous inside it also only took 30 minutes to cook i will try again with the betty hagman gf all purpose mix my dh has a wheat egg and chocolate allergy and it has been difficult to get a white cake especially without eggs,1040
70106,102859,5,i got raves from my co workers when i brought this in for our st patty s day potlock what is different about it is that it is not gummy or goopy or overly sweet as some chicken salads can be i did change a few things in keeping with our green theme i used green onions versus the regular onions called for i used about 6 of them i also used double the mayo 2 3 cup because i had about 4 cups of chicken as you suggested i let the chicken cubes onion salt celery and lemon juice sit overnight in the fridge but before i did i mixed in about a tbs of dry ranch dressing to which i am addicted marie i ll be making this one again,626
198480,1803077585,5,this is the same as challah the traditional jewish braided bread only with pineapple juice and ginger the other difference is challah uses all honey and no sugar so i want to pass along to all that you can this dough let it rise for two hours at room temp then put the dough in a big tub don 039 t seal tight and put it in the fridge for up to a week lt br gt it 039 s much easier to handle when cold and you can simply pull of the amount of dough you 039 ll need and leave the rest in the fridge i 039 ve been doing this method for years and it works for this too fyi a pound of dough the size of a grape fruit will a standard loaf lt br gt you let the dough rest and rise for 90 minutes but it depends on how cold your fridge is lt br gt oh i also this with no kneading and in a ka mix all the wets and the yeast dump the flour on top and with the paddle mix just until all the flour is incorporated about 30 to 60 seconds then do the two hour rise and so forth honestly i 039 ve been making this kind of dough for many years and this works perfectly and is much easier,1071
19052,464330,4,i this dressing for a dinner party everyone loved it it plenty for a party of 6 and i had all the ingredients on hand in my pantry when i prepare this for smaller groups i will half it for posting,196
54367,2000284794,1,terrible turned our to be biscuits oven setting on this way to high and didn 039 t taste,88
228949,366472,3,this certainly wasn t bad but if i were to it again i d a lot of modifications to the sauce it was far too thick and gummy and it really overwhelmed the other ingredients i d probably end up subbing the sauce for tofu and broccoli stir fry with peanut sauce from one of the moosewood cookbooks it s on rz but i can t recall just now,332
169316,377499,5,excellent we ate with chicken tikka masala and naan,51
158671,2001528090,5,i love it and it s a healthy and treat,38
34136,95520,2,i feel little bit bad by writing this one after all the wonderful reviews about this bread in fact the reviews are so that s why i decided to this bread but the thing is that it didn t turned out as i expected i followed exactly the i used green olives stuffed with garlic my favorites i tried very hard not to overmix the dough the final texture was quite compact not at all like any bread i ever had but more like yellow cake the color was very yellowish also probably because of the 2 eggs the crust was quite hard so it tended to crumble and break when i cutted or handled it the taste was strange because it tasted too sweet and not enough salted even with the olives on so this impression helped to feel that i was eating a sort of a dessert cake instead of a bread so if i ever do this again i ll add more salt at least 1 teaspoon and i will reduce the amount of sugar to 1 teaspoon as well i it for dinner and it lasted more or less fresh until the next evening then it got a stale taste and a dry and compact texture and i decided to throw away the leftover so as chrissyo said it was best fresh from the oven i will maybe it again if i can figure out what changes i should to adapt it more to my taste but not soon because we really didn t liked it,1258
77201,733981,5,omg loved loved loved this dh loved also not a big veggie eater but will eat this again i will reduce butter a bit though tish,126
89105,134550,5,i these for my daughter s preschool class along with potato stick fries and chocolate milkshakes i think if the teacher hadn t announced that the kids were going to eat cheeseburger cookies instead of saying cookies that look like cheeseburgers it would have gone over much better lol i found these to be very sweet and not much to my liking however i have to give them bonus points for being flat out adorable i used my edible play dough for the patties and cheese and they truly did look like little cheeseburgers you for this fun,532
203968,392739,5,very left out jalapeno jelly peppers but stll found it delish friends enjoyed it as well gave them as they want to mke it with the hot stuff to follow this is a keeper for parties for sharing,191
117322,1499237,5,best bread ever with this my husband thinks i m an breadmaster actually to my breadmaker and this i feel like the bread master the only changes that i did was used bread flour and skim milk i forgot to brush the tops with butter but it doesn t need it try it if you want a tender soft buttery roll i hot dog buns with half of the dough and the other half is sitting in the freezer don t know if i ll rolls or cinnamon rolls next,428
34881,1574684,5,this was as is but here is some possible changes i ran out of bean mix pretty quickly i think next time i will use more onion beans and tomatoes and tomato sauce i think i might also add rice next time just to give it more filling i also added frank s buffalo sauce to give it some extra kick,292
40497,2002528020,5,i can t believe how they came out they re will definitely be doing this again i put some in some louisiana hot sauce and my oh my 10 10 for sure,144
78189,167024,5,this was a flavorful soup i left out the roux because my husband cant eat wheat and i roaste the peppers cause it seamed like fun turned out,140
19710,127180,5,i ve this 3 times now and it is it s my husband s favourite way to eat cauliflower,82
190075,424008,5,i now have the perfect cornbread i ve been looking for you hill family this will be the only cornbread in my kitchen,116
441236,1802381935,1,these cookies are disgusting rubber on the outside they were undercooked at the 7 minute mark so i put them in for an extra 3 and they were done but they tasted so horrible i wish i had never wasted my time making these cookies there is no way i am going to feed these to anyone they are going in the trash,306
303131,837995,5,these were some beans we had them with hotdogs on the grill and they were enjoyed to the max loved the taste and can t wait to one of your bean sandwiches sounds so for sharing this with us linda it s much appreciated,217
266810,2001375777,3,ranch dressing uh no buffalo chicken and blue cheese go hand in hand use blue cheese dressing plus throw in some chunks of blue cheese if you really want to knock it up a notch,176
14457,224088,4,stuff sticky tart and sweet my husband like the crunchiness of the top best i have a few suggestions for the directions i wouldn t say the first step is creaming as there isn t enough butter for the mixture to get airy i d also say fold in the sour cream then the rhubarb as chucking them both in at the same time combining them a little tough,343
346546,1140371,5,it is very as to the poster who mentioned it was bland i add oregano and sage along with salt and pepper,104
280223,1571202,5,i love this i do add about a cup and a half of sour cream seems to it a bit creamier and rich to me,99
109283,232311,5,very it is an unusual flavor combo but i really liked it i already sent the link to family to try kitchengrrl,109
10833,912491,5,this is a because its so flexible a cook can pick and choose from the optional ingredients to match the rice to their own tastes and the cooking method is a constant i recommend that everyone follow the cooking steps i used the corn peas and the 2 roasted jalepenos,265
282679,745670,5,phenominal french toast i dont even like ricotta cheese normally,64
44124,40620,5,excellent my dad and i love catalina dressing and this is a wonderful homemade version of it we both enjoyed it very much tastes just like the bottled kind,155
89204,2003393,5,i found this through a friend however i this as a dip and it s wonderful the only differences in my are that i use a large jar of medium or hot salsa instead or the normal squat cylinder shaped jars the second difference is that you shred the chicken before serving try two forks and just pull it apart serve with plenty of tortilla chips first time i brought this dip to a party second time i ever it it literally lasted less than 5 minutes i almost didn t get any i put it out and went to the restroom and came back and i had to scrape the bottom to get just half a bowl ful o,578

69924,38865,4,i used angel shredded cole slaw mix we enjoyed this and will it again you mysterygirl,85
211225,1342515,5,i this tonight with some changes don t hate me for changing and reviewing this just might give someone else a new idea i substituted half of the parmesan cheese with panko and in addition to the spices in the i also added a little garlic powder and dried parsley i also used only one egg which seemed sufficient my only cooking spray was pam baking with flour no stick cooking spray it may have helped to add to the crispiness but definitely didn t detract from the i used my convection oven setting not sure if that changed anything either all i can say is that it came out and crispy and flavorful i think you can feel free to adjust the seasonings to suit your taste and change it up when making it i m thinking a little curry powder might be a addition next time,766
308298,1593536,3,i agree starter but i added thyme parsley and sliced mushrooms to give it some extra flavor i mixed the cream of mushroom and cream of brocolli soup with the round roast all day i dont usually eat meat but it smelled and my 1 yr old ate it up fast when my husband gets home i am sure he will love it too,303
38966,96593,5,i will never buy another box of cake mix again this was so hubby and i loved it i have tried other homemade cake recipes but none were as moist as this one flavor and very moist and extremely and fast to give it a try,217
44294,246936,5,very the only thing different i did was added some more spices and added a can of tomatoes i would have used rotel but my grandmother does not like spicey but she loved this soup will again,189
9979,52813,5,so i think though that next time i would cook them for only 20 minutes and i d take them out of the muffin pans before they get too cool they re really though,158
54225,2001580137,5,directions unclear ruined my bananas and i had to build the wall of china out if tin foil in my oven also my cats mad,117
183505,1167867,5,these were so wonderful all i had on had were muffin pans so i them a little larger and used strawberry halves as the wings they still turned out and so beautiful for the,170
56818,399711,5,definitely comfort i added a small amount of finely chopped kale just because it s what i had added a little soy and lemon as other recommended added a little pepper flake because i like a little heat my youngest commented that it tasted like lasagna and most of my family had 2nd s i will this again,300
25167,754126,5,wow these were i theseas an appetizers for a few friends one night and we absolutey loved them i did use small roma tomatoes cut in half and scooped out the seeds i also doubled the these are a definate keeper,209
106641,102135,5,this a it came out just like the picture and tasted my only suggestion would be to use a candy thermometer for posting,118
30191,1533,5,jen at our party this was the mens favorite casserole it is comfort thats for sure we didn t change a thing very to get for pot luck or weekday meal,148
15251,1358784,5,i cut the oil in half since i used a small pan and couldn t find any big zucchini i also used italian style breadcrumbs because i couldn t find plain ones i liked this very much and will be using it again,204
64104,231495,5,this cake was spectacular it s very akin to tres leche or three milks cake it was soooo to moist and decadent try it you ll love it ps pour the cream of coconut mixture i used coco lopez with the condensed milk slowly over the cake to allow it to sink in,254
10744,175824,5,this was i used a bottom crust as my family and i like it that way i also added some peas i was to and not at all time consuming as i used a vegetable cutter to dice up all the vegetables it was because all the veggies were the same size for sharing gt i will be making the again and again,289
43509,851146,5,these are by far the best banana muffins i have ever tasted such a change from other dense doughy recipes so light spongey wonderful texture heaps of flavour i forgot that i wanted to add some chocolate to the mix but the topping was the perfect sweetener for the muffins,271
101476,828038,3,instead of making two thinner loaves i one big one it came out way too salty for some reason i recommend 1 teaspoon more sugar and 12 teaspoon subtraction of salt,162
102677,91340,5,i love brussel sprouts and am always on the lookout for new ways to cook them to get my picky kids to eat them lo and behold even my nine year old ate these he pretended to hate them but not a one was left on his platehehehe i can t wait to these again,252
43072,343922,4,these are very but i would add some sugar next time i will also add a bit more oatmeal next time to them a bit thicker the batter was a little too thin like other reviewers i used 2 whole eggs instead of 4 egg whites all in all a alternative to traditional pancakes and very healthy,282
150384,2776058,5,pretty everyone loved it especially with a cold ceasar salad and hot crunchy french bread i it as the called and it was perfect,127
445325,1800108328,5,i love sandwiches and all of my 7 kids loved which never happens i used season instead of the salad dressing,108
70538,2000483301,5,very directions to follow i did substitute red pepper for the green pepper and use celery seed instead of celery salt and mustard seed instead of mustard makes exactly 5 pints it s,180
25708,6338,4,very tried this last night as a trial run as i have to cook steak and salmon for 83 people in two weeks time very marinade i used shallots and the only mustard i had was creole but turned out very nicely i cooked this on a soaked cedar plank on the grill no need to turn fish this way you for this,297
60992,2034930,5,i d call this more of a gumbo base than a straight roux but i used its technique to some roux for gravy it s hard to give microwave directions without noting the wattage but i used 3 4 cup ap flour to 3 4 cup peanut oil in a 1200w microwave oven with turntable and cooked it for 5 minutes 30 seconds on high and it came out peanut butter roux which is just what i wanted i m thrilled to never have to pan roux again so 5 stars baby warning the pyrex cup real old fashioned borosilicate pyrex handle was extremely hot as was the oil treat this with extreme caution especially because you re going to be pouring hot roux into cold sauce and it will splatter at the interface also there was too much oil in my i had to pour some off i read elsewhere it s supposed to be equal parts by weight not by volume i ll try that next time with my scale,840
320396,1942108,5,i sell these at the farmer s market and they are the most popular once people try them the love them i have been requested to bring them every week,147
200104,253407,4,these are cookies they were a little dry when i mixed them together and i did have to mix them by hand but there is not many ingredients to it a complicated cookie they have a flavor with the addition of cinnamon for posting this cookie,236

54225,2001364024,4,used coconut oil rather then vegetable oil peppermint extract instead of vanilla brown sugar instead of white added milk and chopped andies mints turned out really fluffy,170
65362,2002512616,5,i used to this a lot the first few years i was married it was my fancy dish that was the early 90s i used tuna instead of salmon back then because tuna was cheaper i lost my and found this recently so glad i did my husband and i love this,238
486496,2419792,5,this was will again,19
161704,562865,5,i the first bunch smaller and the larger ones definately taste better more shortbread flavour i also stuffed a chocolate chip into the cherries in some of the cookies which also added a touch for posting,203

35956,28455,5,these beans are wonderful i didnt have monterey jack cheese so i used shredded chedder with jalapenos afterbthey were done i let them thicken up a bit under low heat these are as she says better than restaurant quality and i live in so cal we know refried beans this is my for them from now on so much shirleen donna,316
242319,783601,5,how can you go wrong with croutons cheese and garden fresh tomatoes side dish fast and i too stuck mine in the oven just until the cheese melted it s a way to use up your tomatoes i ll definately be making this again,216
423988,2000363503,5,so much for this excellent it 039 s and fast i added a sprinkle of ground sumac powder which gave it an extra flavor kick i satisfy junk cravings by using this as a dip for fresh tomato wedges you can also mix a little into your regular red pasta sauce to a tangy creamy pink sauce,281
172801,754827,5,we loved this on our chocolate zucchini cake sweet light and mike,65
26754,17649,4,hi i have vegetarian friends and they thought this was wonderful i have to admit i added 1 cup of parmesan cheese but it went down a treat lorraine from brisbane australia,171
348802,894666,5,was used mostly skim milk with a bit of whole milk i completely forgot to add the spinach so,92
85201,507592,4,this was a really appetizer but they are hotter than the store bought boxed frozen variety my guests were amazed at how they were and couldn t believe that i had slaved over these little bites i never told them how they actually were to i doubled the bacon for my version,271
208452,240449,4,almost perfect may add a teaspoon of sugar next time very tho,61
158751,428203,4,my husband and i tried this and we both liked it the flavors were a little different than a lot of chicken dishes we might normally prepare and it was for a change of pace this was quite and quick to prepare i did take the suggestion to deglaze the pan with a little more grape juice i might increase the mint a little more next time,333
28900,141980,4,my whole family enjoyed this dish although it was pretty sweet i ll probably play around with the bbq sauce to try to lessen the sweetness my co worker raved over the leftovers,176
50144,1390242,5,i reduced the size to 2 quarts and it served about 6 portions i used fat free cream cheese and laddled 2 scoops of soup into a bowl to whip it in prior to adding to the soup i didn t have any curdles i also added two stalks of celery and a can of cream of celery soup instead of chicken soup i ll absolutely it again,316
5483,1015092,5,we ve this dip since i was a kid it s so and is always a hit at a party i have to chuckle when someone has to have the,118
51659,308136,4,i leave the pasta sauce off and serve it with some veggies or a salad,69
353138,801828,5,super and filling i threw everything in at the first step and it came out wonderfully you are off to a fabulous start,117
115528,164429,5,this was a hit at my party the vineagar mixture sounded interesting and i just had to try it it tastes several asked for the for posting,136
7373,15511,5,this one is a keeper i used this rather than my old tried and true hey this one is now my tried and true i ve never seen snail butter that calls for butter it s the brandy that puts this over the top don t leave it out,218
59289,1644506,5,love this so fast and no weird ingredients and a huge hit with 4 hungry teens the cream cheese mayo spread was an will do again and again,137
14409,159706,4,brought it to a teacher s luncheon at my child s school and it was a big hit had requests for the,97
89992,1875091,4,this was though i did amend it a bit i cooked it in a dutch oven i cut the chicken into chunks as was recommended but they turned out a bit dry next time i think i ll leave the chicken breasts as is and then cut them afterward i did add some garlic and used regular onions i added the two probably closer to three tablespoons of sour cream to the cream of chicken soup i also added a few splashes of half half and i sprinkled cheese on the top in the last 10 minutes i also let it rest about 15 minutes after it was cooking to let it thicken up a bit and to let the flavors kind of meld together another thing i added some pasta even though it had potatoes it was a very small layer of thin potatoes it was really the only drawback was that the chicken was a bit dry next time i will leave the breasts whole and cut them once they are done cooking overall i was very happy with this dish though next time i do believe i will add more seasoning i like a lot of flavor u2665,972
11307,1435297,5,this comes out perfect everytime i ve added cinnamon and chocolate chips and this banana bread lasts 2 days in my house before its all eaten,140
470291,167849,5,wow these were i doubled the and cut each hot dog bun in half before adding the chili and cheese this allowed folks to try the hot dogs w o committing to a whole one worked well for my superbowl party i cooked these in a foil pan so i could put the whole thing directly in the chafing dish tray and that worked well i used wolf brand no beans chili and the resulting hot dogs tasted my guests devoured them up,409
117892,251206,5,love this turned out wonderful i used an oven safe pan i will try it stovetop next time and see how that goes and maybe even in the rice steamer tfs,148
30234,27442,5,another to add to by breakfast repertoire the tabasco gives this a little added zing not too much just a hint very to as a vatiation i buttered very lightly the bottom of the bread slices when i placed them in a pan i also tried using grated swiss cheese just a litle tastier than cheddar a very interesting mix,311
103632,33902,5,my husband loved this he had three servings and he s really picky about soup this ones going in the family favourites file,122
80156,10100196,5,think i should 039 ve rolled out between the wax paper as suggested,67
77834,1203830,5,this was we re trying to cook with pork more often and i finally decided to branch out and not bread my chops this was so and sooo can t wait for leftovers tonight,163
168857,523796,4,this was really and the best part is the ingredients are items you generally have on hand we like spice so next time i will probably kick it up a notch i did use flour tortillas rather than corn because i always have them in the fridge for sharing,247
361842,1328942,1,this didn t come out right at all i followed the to a t but maybe you should specify how much exactly we need of baking soda because i could have put in too much or too little a pinch could be different for everyone i didn t eat this and threw it out that s how bad it was sorry,278
295649,2000150478,1,i don 039 t know what everyone is raving about mine is as dry as a dry sponge,77
24154,928301,4,i liked these i don 039 t give 5 stars unless i 039 ll crave them but i liked that it cut like an hour off of the time to and i could actually possibly do it after getting off work i traded out some regular flour for wheat flour no other substitutions,251
181686,310001,5,this was so to and tastes just as as take out sweet and sour chicken you for a,78
259677,91988,4,a little confused on the amount of arborio even the bag calls for 1 1 2 cups to serve 4 whereas this calls for 1 cup for 6 gonna it with the spicy chicken from the spicy chicken and lemon risotto also posted wish me luck,220
370128,1382271,5,very except for the cumin if you like cumin use it i use the very same handed down from my parents many people use several kinds of filling pork is in my opinion the best tamal keep up the work mr c,198

380814,1595396,5,leftovers don t see how that s possible for sauce i used 2 jars prego chunky garden added 1 lean ground burger cooked with onion green pepper garlic to taste followed the rest of exactly it s perfect even better than cheddars absolutely love this can t you enough,263
107786,241697,5,the rib lovers had a feast,26
18296,110328,5,i was surprised at how much i like this i have been in a mood for lots of pumpkin lately a restaraunt around here sells pumpkin shakes around this time of year and i never thought that sounded appetizing then i came across this and thought what the heck i added 2 c ice a little more cinnamon and those were my only changes i definitely will try again with yogurt for a little more cream to it all in all very i am the only one here who liked it though so i think next time i would cut the in half with the additional 2 cups ice it quite a lot,543
400661,748816,5,this is just what i wanted for my holiday stuffing you so much for posting this i love it,89
68955,208524,5,this is so and works perfectly by following the exactly i respect personal taste but i wonder if chef charlie brown was using balsamic and if it was fresh as the balsamic reduces it becomes very sweet so no additional sugar should have been necessary i can only imagine that if one did not use balsamic then the would be a disaster and nothing could possibly fix it this has come out perfectly every time when i am bored with trying to figure out what to serve next this one always pops to mind and everyone loves it i usually serve it with a small salad and jasmine rice with peas and lemon for the idea,604
154473,2002266267,5,i cook a lot my kids have been exposed to all types of cuisine but this basic soup is one of their favorites ridiculously and i have all the ingredients on hand all the time i just bake some biscuits or warm up a baguette and dinner is done,240
107546,1049696,5,i was looking for something as an extra side dish for thanksgiving and found this what a flavor and the prep could not have been easier i will pass this on to family and friends,177
23733,32411,5,anyone who loves peanut butter will absolutely love these they are incredibly quick and to very very addictive i 039 d love to put chocolate chips in it right before it sets,173
73825,1597051,5,so very better than any i have had so much for the,50
198509,2850108,2,i am going to be generous here and give this one 2 stars sorry i put them on at night before bed and got up early to check them 5 a m and they were way to smushy and overcooked if you like your steel cut oats that way then bless ya i prefer mine with more of a quot chew quot i will pass on this and try something new until i get it perfect,340
19282,217047,4,you can tell that you replaced butter with oil but no vegan is perfect and it was because my parents think vegan stuff tastes like crap but they actually throughly enjoyed them,176
2886,2000962763,5,this is it really is the best banana bead,41
44222,194829,5,what a hit everyone loved it took it to a march madness basketball party and the men devoured it,96
131436,597669,5,i have had this saved for some time but now that the weather is cooler i got out all the ingredients and it this is wonderful i used granular spenda for the sugar and used sugar free hazelnut creamer but followed directions for everything else i a double batch and will be sharing for posting this,297
142960,116371,5,had this once at a baby shower w o the almonds and loved it this time around with the almonds loved it even more it for christmas and everyone even the kids devoured it,168
31516,1270901,3,i only used 3 chicken breast halves and felt that there was too much chicken compared to the rice mixture i will with 1 or 2 chicken breast halves next time and 45 50 minutes was not nearly long enough the chicken was cooked on top and raw on the bottom it took my dish 1hr 15min to get done i would suggest cutting the chicken into bite size pieces and mix in with the rice mixture to get the cooking time down to 45 min also some of the rice was undercooked i think this could be corrected by stirring the dish about half way through the flavor was but i added some diced jalapenos when eating the leftovers and it was even better,632
66294,451155,5,simply excellent i had tried something like this at a potluck a month or so ago and was not happy with the i had been given this is exactly what i have been looking for as a side dish dip relish also rave reviews from all who tried it,234
16887,570662,2,this makes very puffy onion rings not crunchy at all more like funnel cake onions i should have known when i saw the baking powder,130
255660,1803533292,4,i would add a little more flour mine was waaaay too sticky and i had to add more flour,86
17953,377039,4,i the as directed except to substitute boneless ribs instead of chops and use one tablespoon of chili powder instead of 1 4 cup that was more than enough chili pepper i d say it was just about right this was pretty very different from our normal foods but i couldn t get the sauce to thicken in the crock so i pulled it out to a pan to thicken which worked nicely i didn t think the flavor was the slightest bit oriental but it was i might this again and if i do it will be without change the flavors melded well and it was even though it didn t have the wow factor,565
188461,1025608,5,i this often in the summer to eat with crackers and a salad for a lunch and for you i don t put celery in mine but thr rest is pretty standard,142
90240,142617,5,this is wonderful on pancakes with some maple syrup or a spoon of raspberry jam spooned over it my 5 year old grandson loves this and gains 2 pounds every time he visits,169
204852,423565,5,omg i have been looking for this for over three years now this is so and i m so grateful that you posted it eileen,114

374398,2002346996,5,i have this exact for my family 3 times now the flavor of each ingredient mesh so well with one another this omelet is absolutely divine you won t leave hungry i will be adding this to my family book to keep forever you dienia,226
259509,2200046,5,i love this i have served it to many i usually use pink lady red or golden apples it is always i usually add a little extra cinnamon and sometimes a little heavy on the vanilla i also use only organic ingredients and it comes out fantastic every time always the winner when i have people over or go to some event people always ask for the cobbler,346
129926,2001388581,4,most definitely a keeper i love spicy so i added more onions some garlic and jalape ntilde o peppers to the chicken when saut eacute ing,136
74046,117396,5,the only change i was to add 1 teaspoon of cumin i loved the taste the roasted tomatoes and garlic gave the soup i it for my family to test it out before making a double for a family gathering the first time i only had canola oil but bought some olive oil for the next batch it really a difference and for the better i ve always substituted canola for olive in all recipes but i won t anymore everyone loved it,410

219420,2001356166,5,the original from southern living magazine calls for it to be baked in a 9 quot x 3 quot pan although the presentation is lacking the results up for it i also a smaller batch of frosting as the amount the calls for overpowers the cake,234
45798,66983,5,di this is a winner works for all types of mexican meal meats i ve used in chili and on ground turkey for nachos and tacos,122
43331,43216,5,these are wonderful even without the frosting i have to the frosting lol but the kids already ate half the cookies we ri,120

66294,203823,5,this was i was a little concerned about the amount of oil in the dressing but it wasn t oily at all i didn t use the full can of black beans and i used probably 2 cups of corn,175

107997,57437,5,i have this twice so far but am sure i will it over and over again i absolutely love shrimp and this was fantastic love the spice and the garlic i used a half of pound of large e z peel shrimp and left off the zest as i just used lemon juice,241
24905,2213021,4,i this cake but i had to do so twice because of the amount of flour as printed on this version basically i could only use 1 and one fourth cups of flour maximum one and one fourth not 5 and a fourth so i m not sure how other reviewers didn t note this problem unless the has been altered somehow from original printing that said once i that change and lightened the batter a bit with a cup of the whipped whites before folding in it was just the white cake i was looking for other tips unmold cake onto rack immediately to avoid uneven shrinking also this cake filled an 11 x15 inch sheet pan and my cake served over 30 people once filled and frosted so the quantity is probably another typo still excellent light and delicate white cake once you get it right,759
299654,351578,5,this is a shake we loved everything about it,44
99476,291980,3,this was just ok for us the taste of soy sauce was overpowering and i would have like to take more of the other spices i would have liked it to be just a bit sweeter as well we won t this again but for posting,209

58593,278516,4,really unusual we went without the celery used crushed chili crushed pureed peanuts we might add a potato with the carrots next time too,136
24086,240942,5,for canning and long term storage use a small stick of cinnamon rather than ground and reduce the cloves to just two per pint jar i used red wine vinegar instead of white to play up the red of the beets,202
57082,99594,5,very flavor and low calorie everything i want in a meal i highly recommend it,77
137111,290298,5,fantastic i also mine in the bread maker on the dough setting quick and thankyou miss elizabeth for sharing,107

31901,490713,4,to but a mistake of baking for full 45mins peach cobbler became a bit dry when cooled next time i will reduce baking time for sharing,133
47354,1541074,5,the interesting thing about this soup is that it tasted incredibly familiar to me despite the fact that i have never it before i darn near felt nostalgic eating it i guess it goes without saying that i liked this soup very much and i have a feeling it will become a staple i followed the with one exception the addition of a few cloves of the almighty garlic,358
56103,129796,3,these were but i think next time i will put some garlic in like others have suggested also found them a little tastier with a dash of lemon juice thankyou for posting,166
65641,376189,5,this was only change was that i added a few fresh herbs i will definitely this again,84
154351,1126368,5,this was a very dressing to and very ididn t feel like bothering with the garlic preparation so i used a dash of garlic powder instead otherwise i followed the it had a zing without being too bold or too bland it was just right it turned a salad of greens into something delightful it was so in fact that i had another salad later in the evening as a snack for the,364
46044,116371,4,this is pretty my family liked it fairly well we will be having it again ginny p,80
11001,224170,5,i got this years ago from a college roomate i frequently it for dinner parties b c it can be done ahead and is always a hit a friend who owns a small inn asked for the to serve to her guests i have served it with rice and snow peas or snap peas and a green salad w mandarin oranges,281
87782,405313,4,these worked wonderfully with the rack of lamb i a dinner party last night along with kittencal s greek salad when i these again it is inevitable i will probably play with the water oil lemon juice ratio just for fun i agree with the other reviewer who said that this is a very forgiving dish i had a million things going on in the kitchen last night and they ended up in the oven for longer than they should have but they still came out who knows maybe even better,465
307189,165308,1,i don t prefer writing bad reviews but this dish is a terrible waste of the presentation is terrible due to the cottage cheese the flavor amounts to almost nothing i had half a serving tossed the rest in the garbage disposal i it because the reviews were very it did sound interesting i would suggest you save the noodles for alfredo sauce the onions peppers for a salad the cottage cheese to mix with some pineapple the yogurt for an afternoon snack i wish i had,463
100666,327989,5,these were very i was worried about them not fitting into a 9x13 so i in my two 8 cake pans they didn t last long and will be again and again,141
23821,37516,5,they are so,11
7678,2628046,5,this was my two yr old licked it off the plate,46
169571,58430,5,i used half whole wheat flour in this and it turned out well i precooked the crust for 8 minutes before adding toppings i was not really able to stir the batter with the whole wheat mixture seems it soaked up too much water i simply kneaded it for about two minutes right it the bowl and ended up with texture,309
160283,1458497,4,super and dish i m going to try it with scrambled eggs next time for breakfast,78

209226,525536,5,hurray glad to know someone else remembers these treats and i agree jigglers don t even come close,98
41567,1273968,5,perfection raves by all 8 guests just the best here s what i did curd ahead and chill whip 2 c heavy cream with pinch salt until stiff fold in half the curd now lay thin slice any yellow or white cake on dish add 2 tbsp pure curd top with generous dollop of cream decorate with fresh berries and sprig of mint i used blackberries,329
106095,244903,5,since i found this i have it several times these cookies are so they pratically melt in your mouth once you these cookies you will be hooked on them they do not last very long in my house once my grandkids smell the cookies in the oven they keep asking me when they will be done,278
26110,91867,3,these biscuits were but not i think it may have more to do with the biscuit maker than the though i used my processor to these next time i think i will try making them by hand the biscuits did not rise very much so i think i will let the dough sit for a few minutes before cutting out the biscuits i will try making these again and i will review the again,355
33578,70411,5,caramels i ll be making them every christmas i m the candy girl in my family and i always tons of it for the holidays and everyone gave these rave reviews,154
15344,282066,5,very i used 2 lbs meat and tripled the sauce added 1 2 cup water and a little more worcestershire sauce also i was out of onions so i added onion powder but it still came out my picky kids loved it which is always a plus,220
76211,110135,5,i told my diabetic husband not to even breath near these bars they are sooo sooo bad but soooo soooo kind of reminds me of seven layer bars but not as overtly sweet delish,171
45809,370067,5,taste i would add corn startch to get the suce thicker like they have it in malls i used thigh meat just because it it s jucier and substituted apple for orange juice and vinegar for balsamic vinegar,199
94412,2002086450,5,they are not even done and already i can see the texture is far superior to the other i ve been using for years yummmm can t wait to serve these up tomorrow,156
27861,621502,5,mhhh these were i mixed the rhubarb with some strawberries and used some nutmeg with the cinnamon i think i ll try out some more fruit variations for posting update i also used apples instead of rhubarb and they turned out,222
28076,425213,5,i used mountain dew and frosted with lemon cream cheese frosting very well received by all at a family picnic a lemon cake,122
10350,181781,5,simply said these are the best i have ever had in my 50 years headin to the market for more peppers miss annie little note i used mexican oregano here it is 5 years later and 2015 and i 039 m still using this,208
82823,224930,5,i this last night and it was the only things i did different were i did not use pork rind flour just can t get used to that stuff so i just patted the garlic powder and salt into the meat and browned it in the butter set that aside and sauteed my fresh mushrooms in the brown bits had to add a little more butter and then just added the cream and water to the mushrooms then i let it cook until the liquid had reduced and thickened some and put my meat back in the sauce i let it set a few minutes which seemed to help the thickening process so i ended up with a creamy mushroom sauce and the whole thing was sooooooo delish for the wonderful idea,647
124074,1631411,5,needed a change from the normal pasta salad this was very enjoyable and to i will definitely this again you for posting,119
276759,1932691,4,this was a comfort meal the family liked it and best of all i usually have the ingredients on hand i did add an onion 2 chopped summer squash to increase veggie content turkey kielbasa instead of regular a touch of paprika and splash of hot sauce and 4 oz cream cheese the cream cheese and regular cheese i used were low fat i think this would have been without my changes my 4 year loved it i haven t tried freezing it yet did anyone else,439

271313,2000407935,5,five stars in my book it is versatile and a better use of leftover staffing than just reheating it i forgot to roast some garlic so i just sprinkled in some garlic powder i didn t have a small casserole so i used a pie plate my cheese was a mix of swiss cheddar and monterey jack i used leftover turkey as my meat see versatile,327
61917,430109,5,these muffins are and very moist i had frozen blueberries so i added them to the top of the muffins after filling the cups so i wouldn t end up with purple muffins the batter is thick so i should have pushed them down into batter as they sat at the top but they were just the same they are also very to definitely a keeper,322

34881,1870648,5,i just this tonight for the first time i loved it the black beans were perfect and the flavors delish i have a feeling i ll be making this regularlly,149
4793,404181,3,i thought i could overcome the chunks o butter problem mentioned in another review by using my trusty stir stick hand blender but i still had verrry tinnny butter lumps i doubled the and would use less salt wheni saute the nuts in butter but for now dad says no more 20 00 ice cream,282

13386,862233,5,this was really really really with a few small changes looking at this and other similar recipes it seemed like an awful lot of sugar so i omitted one of the cups i also replaced 1 5 cups of the flour with whole wheat flour finally i don t have loaf pans so i tried this in a springform pan on 350 it took about an hour and a half and came out perfect don t trust me on this i tested every 10 15 minutes for the last 45 minutes and my oven runs a little cool it s just slightly dense in a way whole wheat flour i could really taste the orange juice in the batter the batter was but not so much in the finished product when i this again i might experiment with adding orange zest still the banana and cranberry flavors stand on their own,736
35393,2001563742,4,these muffins are i also got 5 more muffins then the said i would get,69
43899,366487,5,a friend gave me this he brings it to his family s thanksgiving every year so i had to try it my family loved it it s similar to the green bean casserole i usually however i did it a little different i omitted the croutons and 1 4 cup of butter using only 3t to saute onions after i mixed everything together i topped with italian bread crumbs very for posting,360
129556,210473,5,not greasy served on buttery crackers with a ham cube yum,57
26370,2001193463,4,this is the hershey s black magic cake and i ve seen it mislabeled many times it s the best chocolate cake but it is hershey s and i ve been using it for years remember to use parchment paper in the bottom of your pan and cake release as this is a very moist cake and chocolate cakes are notorious for breaking you can t taste the coffee but it gives a rich taste to the cake so don t leave it out this is my go to chocolate cake check out the hershey site for the as well as frosting recipes i gave it a four because i haven t tried out the frosting,550

345793,2001581203,5,one of the best things i have ever,34
225291,140787,5,out of this world i used a lemon cake mix and 1 4 cup poppy seeds this last night and ds walked in and thought the place smelled wonderful and then he ate a piece right out of the oven and said it was the best he ever had dh echoed the same bought it to work today and a co worker is going to it this weekend you for a wonderful,328
62670,755869,4,the sauce turned out a little disastrous for me i should have done a rough chop of the cloves before cooking them the prescribed amount of time was not sufficient to soften them and the liquid ended up evaporating i added more but by then i think the whole thing was just off i used the listed directions for seasoning the meat but i put it in the oven on 250 for 4 hours while we went to church when we came home i bumped up the temp and cooked a little longer until done the flavor turned out and was exactly what i d hoped for when i bought the meat i m just bummed about the sauce being a flop,597
298216,2084662,4,had a very strong egg taste that no amount of seasoning covered up,66
104150,50260,5,my family raved about this i believe this is the we ll be using from now on,75
121853,549460,5,i finally found something to do with my squash out of the garden i altered the some but these came out i am trying to cut back on calories so i used egg beaters light margarine 1 1 2 cups splenda and i subsituted 1 cup of flour for whole wheat flour i then added 1 tsp vanilla 3 tsp cinnamon and 1 2 teaspoon of nutmeg these were excellent and my 6 year old loved them,368
314270,45848157,5,husband who is pretty fussy about his mac 039 n cheese loved this and did not miss the higher fat cheese and milk i did put a few panko bread crumbs on top to add a bit of a crunch yum so much for the smellyvegetarian,217
108105,2945846,5,the flavor in this dish was incredible only changes i were based on some of the comments i read i used low salt soy sauce and cut the chicken into chunks rather than use breast i also prepared the sauce as if i were using 6 servings chicken breasts but only used 4 breast it came out i also used scallions to top it off it was a big hit you tidbits,348
131172,170440,5,we had these for dinner saturday night and they were excellent end of the season corn on the cob and coleslaw to go with them for sharing the,141
165254,2000069476,5,last week i bought two 1 1 2 inch steaks at publix and brought them home i froze one for this week and cook the other using a low and slow method i found online i was incredibly disappointed with the low and slow steak which came out very tough and was worried that the meat was poor quality tonight i tried this method i used a stainless steel skillet and seasons my steak with one of the kc seasoning steak mixes including black pepper garlic and sea salt this steak is tender and perfectly rare and mind you that this steak was frozen for a week and thawed in the refrigerator overnight and it still came out better than the other method,640
10309,283738,4,i this dish last night it was very rich and creamy i will defiantly be making this one again i like my red peppers cooked a bit so i threw them in with the sauce ahead of time yum,179

27208,597054,5,how could i have not reviewed this yet this is super and the so loves it very flavorful i did as some other reviewers suggested and only added 1 2 the packet of ranch to cut down on the saltiness and it comes out perfect everytime for posting such an dish,255
73238,50313,5,i only marinated about 4 hours for the rub i used accent for the meat tenderizer emeril s essence for the seasoned salt and garlic salt instead of powder since the essence isn t very salty the marinade i followed exactly well it was lite soy sauce and i did have fresh ginger on hand summary wonderful for sharing,313
176424,650834,3,i used butter not margarine and baked in a sheet pan i m not sure if that a big difference but i was disappointed by the lack of peanut butter flavor it was just okay,166
143045,2000500635,5,2 batches and had quot your own panzerotti quot night i used half beer and half water the beer gives it a really restsurant flavour my family of 6 all loved them i brushed olive oil on them out of the oven making them again tonight hungry just thinking about it,261
42222,776054,5,5 star all the way flavor just plain peanut butter cookies,58
149654,244180,5,and to i used fewer eggs 5 instead of 10 less cheese 2 milk instead of cream and chicken sausages to cut down on the fat and calories you can pretty much guesstimate the amount of hashbrowns you need a definite keeper,217

4178,876077,5,this is a family favorite so to and keeps well in the fridge for the next day,77
109488,1184631,5,for the dip i used 1 2 c vanilla yogurt 1 4 c coconut milk and 1 4 pineapple instead it tasted a little vanillay but was really i 1lb of shrimp instead of half a pound and had plenty of the wet batter but had to more panko breading im glad i a whole pound though they went fast this was really and really wasnt too time consuming in my opinion just be sure to get all the shrimp breaded before you start frying them unless you have someone helping i ll be making these again soon,479
72963,2001442218,5,i followed the exactly i the southern style dumplings i used homemade chicken broth it may have been more fatty than the boxed broth my dumpling dough was way too wet so i ended up adding more flour and baking powder until it was the right consistency i ended up adding carrots to the soup before adding the dumplings for more flavor and personal taste my family loved it and we had the leftovers tonight you for a wonderful reminds me of my grandma s from alabama,464
180718,22174,5,and so healthy too only changes i was whole milk and added cinnamon i could have left them in a bit longer as they are a little underdone but ever so moist and just the right sweetness too my bananas were so ripe they were banana soup i used large raisins too lauralie for aussie swap 24,287

96948,754772,5,what a cake this is sure you don t over cook it watch it carefully during the last minutes of cooking my wife this and used nuts in the topping instead of the coconut what a dessert you tony,190
50767,340776,5,these are i added some frozen peas and carrots cooked the chicken in garlic and olive oil and added some seasoning salt to the chicken mixture the veggies probably added some extra moisture which the texture more like chicken pot pie than something that can be eaten without utensils i also used lowfat cream cheese to reduce the fat a little none of this seemed to a difference as we really enjoyed them i ll be making these again,431
38224,407781,5,yum this was i a few minor changes because of what i had on hand instead of the frozen orange juice concentrate i just had minute maid orange juice in a carton not frozen and subbed for that i did have the frozen banana as i had thought about making some type of smoothie with it yesterday so i stuck that in the freezer i omitted the sugar and added 2 teaspoons of gourmet vanilla extract also omitted the ice cubes the frozen banana it plenty cold for me next time i ll with vanilla soy milk so my hubby can have some too outstanding this will be a keeper,557
182657,574936,4,we liked this dish i had been struggling with trying to figure out what to for supper and couldn 039 t think of anything that uses ingredients i already had and then i came across your this was quick and very to prepare i minor changes by tossing in a couple of pieces extra of the bacon a tad more cheese and had to use white onion you for the i know i 039 ll prepare it again,377
169935,1863642,5,this is absolutely i was skeptical at first but those were the only ingredients i have at home so i it turns out and super quick you,132
74251,352538,5,very cookies i them as written except used salted butter my picky 15 year old says you can taste the pepper and so he wont eat them but i think they are marvelous they do have a bit of a bite to them but in a really way i will them again to keep some dough in the freezer in logs they will be for last minute company i d like to try them using the added cinnamon that some reviewers mentioned and maybe some chipotle powder to kick the heat up even more,453
135761,305147,4,very though i cheated and used some canned diced tomatoes and the second time didn t bother marinating and we think it was just as i served it with a lemon celery pilaf and even my four year old gobbled it up and had it for lunch the next day,242

24051,34146,5,this today and it was wonderful i was wondering if using lowfat sour cream makes a difference in the setting time it took about 6 hours but it did set think next time i might try it with strawberries since we love those too hummmm i wonder if blueberries would work for an dessert,280

432805,88981,5,loved this read prior reviews that said needed something but went ahead and as written patty pans have a buttery mild taste and these fritters reflected that awesomely kids ate them like crazy then asked to sprikle with sugar for dessert veggies for dessert yes,261

11799,754909,5,this cream filling is perfect not at all greasy or gritty like others i ve tried i used a milk chocolate cake and classic chocolate icing both store bought i also doubled the cream filling i like a little cake with my icing who doen t love a ho ho,247

183270,696326,5,we this with giada s marinara it was flawless i found the sauce meatballs makes pasta topping for sharing d,107
464085,2002518393,5,i this bread for game day yesterday and we all loved it i used gluten free flour but that s the only change i it turned out beautifully tasted wonderful and reminds me of gingerbread definitely a quick bread for autumn and the holiday season,241
109488,1828504,5,the next best thing to real red lobster coconut shrimp my family loves this copycat,83
10212,32143,4,really i saw it in taste of home magazine and checked to see if it was here i left out the celery and green peppers added celery salt and used less salt i would probably double next time it only filled half my crockpot served with 33489 and bbq chips,250
11961,237154,5,this fudge was a snap to but it definitely sets up fast i laid a piece of plastic wrap over the top and then used my hands to smooth out the fudge you can definitely taste the jd everyone that tried it just loved it di,218
28662,37608,5,i also will be making this all summer it is a perfectly refreshing side dish with flavours i used a 1 4 clove of garlic with regular salt instead of the garlic salt and served it with small portions of macaroni and cheese 19843 ooh i ll bet the leftover juice would be a addition to a bloody caesar or mary,306
26177,64549,2,not for beginners adding the olive oil to a hot pan almost started a fire in my apartment maybe i wasn t using the correct pan i ended up broiling it in the oven i like spicy foods but this was too spicy for me i ll stick to ordering it at a restaraunt if it sounds and to you then please try it i am just a beginner,316
230988,353381,5,i love this i added a little extra water and put some chicken boullion in it to stretch it while still giving it flavor excellent i too added some fresh onions i ve also it adding a couple of tablespoons of pizza sauce which is excellent too,241
47624,170126,5,to i a few adaptions to reduce dryness and saltiness i switched town house crackers for the saltines and delted the extra cheese on top it for thanksgiving everyone loved it family wants me to bring it again for our christmas dinner,232
4370,1426364,5,i used parsley instead of sage added some crushed chillies and i added the seasoning half way through the cooking time i had been looking for a copycat of the potatoes of montreal s lebanese chain amir and this is the closest that i have tasted,244
64376,83400,5,this was just wonderful loved the combination of green beans with the sweet vinegar and savory bacon for posting this will be a favorite,136
26876,588049,5,this makes such a toad in the hole i chilled the batter as other commenters suggested and it rose golden and beautiful in the oven i used a 14 ounce pack of hillshire farms sausage and they cooked very well but the batter that was the star it turned all crispy around the edges and in the middle it was soft but not doughy almost like a fluffy omelet this one will be joining my repertoire for sure,398
8178,364143,5,i tried this and substituted fresh strawberries for the cherries as i am not a cherry lover myself,98
2886,99221,5,the name of this banana bread is all wrong this is scrumptious best banana bread i added some cinnamon nutmeg and allspice too also i used real butter and i used splenda instead of the sugar also used increased the pure vanilla extract to 3 4 teaspoon i used about 3 4 cup finely chopped walnuts didn t have a loaf pan so i used an 8x8 glass pan i sprinkled a little brown sugar on top did i mention this is scrumptious yum thx ikadlec chef judi coleman,453
445387,11973399,4,the pot roast is i am making the gravy as we speak and for my taste i would reduce the wine to 1 cup the carrots came through too strongly as i had feared i like carrots but they are a very sweet veggie while i did also add some mushrooms i would use a lot more next time and only a smidgen of carrots we all have different taste buds,334
94211,776436,5,this is an weeknight meal for me and my daughter,48
165255,2001519865,5,added lemon verbina i am going to try different vinegars see photo submitted,76

1693,218516,5,meatballs i love serving them over rice with a green veggy on the side,70
32042,2001014958,5,this is extraordinary i it simply for a monday night dinner the only thing i changed was to use bacon grease instead of vegetable oil to the roux and used a bit more creole seasoning and used shrimp chicken and andouille sausage my family ate all but i cup full the first night you for this quick and meal,305
75644,2002228520,5,these today best ever just like tim hortens cake donuts,55
523759,951133,5,i this last night and we loved it the flavor is delightful and the chicken thighs were so tender i used 2 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs and french s dijon mustard and followed the directions exactly if you re not sure of the mustard then cut the amount in half but do try this for some reason the sauce didn t thicken up to my liking so next time i will probably double the cornstarch or cook the sauce in a saucepan over heat you for sharing this wonderful,464
116115,643508,5,i really liked this i it wheat gluten free by using the special flour and breadcrumbs i used plaice which i wouldn t usually consider battering but it worked i also added a little cayenne chilli pepper and my fish hating bf loved it i served it with quartered baby potatoes oven roasted in rosemary oil a tin of peas and a bottle of champagne to commiserate the emergency supplementary budget the irish goverment announced today for a,434
18648,57788,2,we were a bit disappointed with this one it was okay but we decided it was not a keeper,87
18693,159532,5,my non vegetable eating son loved it i would give you 5 stars for that alone but the rest of us loved it too you,112
139518,217634,3,this wasn t what i was expecting i cupcakes for valentine s day for my daughter s class and was disappointed it was more like a spongecake than a white cake and the cupcakes didn t rise into a dome but were flat on top like a mushroom,234
97824,1084410,5,love it i helped my 7 year old daughter this for her teacher for christmas and it turned out wonderful the best part was that it was so she didn t really need any help at all and she felt telling her teacher she did it all by herself,233
123588,834555,5,piza i added fresh slices tomatoes a few black olives and when it comes out of the onion i added fresh torn basil leaves,120
4956,74364,5,this was i didn t have the hunts tomato sauce so i used a large can of chopped tomatoes and a little can of tomato paste otherwise i followed the exactly yumm,158
158138,354757,5,what a fabulous i did slightly alter it for the soups except the cheddar cheese i used lower sodium 98 fat free soups and i also found that 1 tsp of red chili powder was not nearly enough i don t like burn my mouth off hot but i probably used closer to 1 8th cup i found the flavor was closer to max erma s and it also helped with the taste a bit better from the lower fat soups but bravo to sue,395
218751,98511,1,i attempted this today but it didn t turn out even with an expert breadmaker assisting the dough wouldn t come out right it was very sticky with the suggested amount of flour and we needed to add much more to have the proper consistency the dough did not rise even with brand new yeast and plenty of extra time we finally just tossed it as the dough wasn t workable following the directions i ll try one of the other english muffin recipes next time,449
177892,293016,5,this is a keeper we grilled the chicken and it was,50
171698,1803659528,1,not even remotely a beignet lt br gt lt br gt if you this expecting the soft sweet texture of a traditional beignet you will be disappointed lt br gt lt br gt this is just a for the quot elephant ears quot of fried dough from a carnival gross,242
30307,19799,4,a bit sweet for our tastes next time i will cut back on the brown sugar but it had flavor and we loved the cooked bits of garlic and onion left on the steak after cooking i want to try this with chicken breasts next time i bet it will be,237
136678,1802959801,5,very going to add chicken to it next time we it,47
5170,11872230,4,yummm light and fluffy i did cut the sugar to 2 tbs and salt to 1 2 tsp we are trying to cut back on both didn 039 t miss it and were fabulous,142
54220,76663,4,this was very and i just overdid the tabasco sauce and suffered for it all night,80
177840,1323216,4,i love this so does my husband i didn t have vanilla so i used orange flavoring and it was quite refreshing i had never used agar agar before and i m super jazzed to try other things with it my son won t eat it b c of the thicker texture but i think that s my fault cuz i called it jello i only 1 2 the b c i just wanted to try it out and wanted to see how it would react to certain molds and how it keeps in bento i m making it again as soon as i can d,453
1209,380238,4,this as an appetizer for thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it like others said just as as some restaurants recipes to put together then just throw in oven will be making this again,185
145165,2002900085,5,different taste different with using milk instead of cream i was very suprised plus it was when putting parmasan cheese on top of it,132
53878,468996,5,these are never any leftovers and everyone begs for the,55
387151,621782,5,my husband began making pancakes for breakfast this morning and discovered he didn t have enough box mix he asked me to find a i choose this one and it is a keeper they are and fluffy and very i am going to a freezer batch this weekend for quick breakfast during the week,271
318838,315084,5,this is an excellent hot chocolate we were simply blown out of the water at the wonderful taste of this mix it is far superior to any store bought mix i have tried and that includes the sugared ones i believe the pudding gives it that boost to it so special but it is a keeper and have gave it out to several people already so much for posting this,348
9326,2936576,5,most muffin i ever had in my life,33
155430,1803132479,5,this is soooo just one load and it came out so perfectly we reduced half of the to one load and added some rosemary to it smells and tastes so and it was very to prepare i am sure this is the one to go for us so much,216
299939,716186,4,and wonderful for a quick summer lunch the kids also loved it,61
312817,234062,4,this was quick and lovely the consistency makes it more of a pudding than a cake i suspect and with icecream it was a perfect pudding for drop in guests only thing is don t use olive oil for the oil as it leaves a bit of an aftertaste,234
434903,2000645891,5,this was excellent amp i would highly recommend it it came out seeming much harder to than it actually was the cake was an elegant firm wedding cake type consistency that cannot be yielded from a box mix i could not believe how the frosting was given the simplicity of the ingredients i was not piping the frosting so i whipped mine a bit more than directed but it won rave reviews i used dickinson 039 s lemon curd as a filling and omitted the almonds at the request of the birthday boy and was pleased at the way the lemon amp the almond flavor in the cake balanced it was really i think you could experiment with fillings to suit the tastes of your guests but a tarter filling would better balance the sweetness of the frosting,730
49909,345731,5,really really pesto i used parm 1 2 cup olive oil and i toasted some almonds instead of pinenuts my son is allergic to peanut and i couldn t find pinenuts free of trace peanut so i used blue diamond almonds which are peanut free and on the advice of a previous reviewer i added a pinch of salt my husband who normally doesn t get excited about pesto loves it for the,366
88939,426664,5,i have this 3 times in 3 weeks my family said that s the only way they want grilled chicken for now on it is so i add a tsp of dijon mustard and use fresh garlic,161
16632,274719,5,i have loved this for a long time tart and sweet for posting,60
128439,4862,5,it was such a hit at my church especially for my vegetarian friends i tweeked it and fried up some choriso in the place of the green chilis outstanding i also took it out about ten minutes before it was done added some sliced tomatoes and a handful of shredded cheese popped it back in the oven for ten minutes luved it sooooooooooooo to big hit in my family thanx for sharing,376
362458,2048545,5,super i just added some avocado and cilantro at the end,55
83524,178089,5,this was we eat it as an entire meal i have it several times now and we can not get enough and i am not a big cabbage fan i have added bacon and that was and just bacon bits was i also add durkee six pepper blend and that gives it a big kick love it,249
357873,2002688126,5,i tried this during the covid 19 quarantine i wanted to a soup that called for 1 cup of heavy cream i followed the very directions and it worked like a charm i can t you enough for sharing this it ll now be my go to for heavy cream,231
194865,2001368641,5,this is quite i did not change a thing i have used lemon in chicken and noodles before because it needs less salt that way what i like about this is how the sauce is on angel hair pasta so the chicken breast and pasta and a salad meal and so best of all to me it was all from things i had in my cupboard,303
8782,983811,5,tasting and so moist,20
20480,2002187693,5,i roasted the broccoli florets cooked some sliced mushrooms and added that to the excellent low carb gluten free meal,117
32555,1555677,5,this was wonderful i too changed it up a bit i used olive oil margarin instead of butter added a can of diced tomatoes instead of fresh and added 4 green onion stalks instead of 3 i also added some garlic powder on top it was i really impressed my finance,255
102506,1041450,5,it was very all my kids liked it it may be pot luck dish too,60
19821,2000232558,5,i used this amp it is a base to create a pasta salad i also add small or half of a big green pepper rough chopped about 12 15 halved cherry tomatoes about a 1 2 of a can of sliced black olives pepperoni slices stacked amp quartered 1 tsp onion powder b c my kids just won 039 t eat onions amp two bags of kraft crumbles cheese to die for my kids can 039 t get enough amp i like the fact that they get a variety of veggies as well,429
32844,800414,5,stuff next time i will get a better quality sausage to it even better i added musrooms to mine as well this is a keeper,119
366578,2118207,5,i love this for potatoes i also peel my potatoes but very roughly as to leave a touch of skin i love adding more cheese than this calls for because we love cheesy potatoes swiss is an ok sub but there is something about the real gruyere that is just very very i will continue to be proud serving these wonderful potatoes at any meal,332
233576,154322,4,i thought this dish was really i had nearly everything on hand oddly enough it was perfect to use up those vegetables that weren t quite enough for a side dish of their own the vegetable mix had a almost stewish richness to the texture it tasted distinctly moroccan i love this combination of spices the talapia i put on top was a little frozen still and thin so i cooked for 30 mins it was perfect flavorful and distinct and really went well with the vegetables served over basmati rice my neighbor joined me for dinner and ate all of hers but didn t like it enough for seconds i think it was probably just not her thing though for a i can t wait to have the rest for lunch tomorrow,683

30596,539977,4,this was i misread the and used all the juice from the lemon i doubled this and i didn t have 1 2 1 2 so i used 1 cup nonfat milk and 1 cup whipping cream mine did not curdle you have to boil the lemon juice for atleast 30 seconds then whisk the half and half in and keep whisking while it reduces i served this with chicken thighs with sweet onion balsamic relish 107384 after both sauces were done i pulled the meat off the bone and mixed back into the balsamic relish then mixed this in with this lemon pasta and it was a fabulous balance the sweetness balanced out the tartness of the lemon superb,601

17181,55017,5,flavor very different taste from what we have every other day of the week loved the feta which is not something that i use a whole lot because i don t care for the strong taste but it very much complimented the sweetness of the sauce a lot,239
314388,1671995,3,i agree with reviewer jazze22 that it 039 s too vinegary for a ketchup based bbq sauce i don 039 t bbq sauce much anymore so i doubt if i 039 ll it again but if i did i 039 d cut the apple cider vinegar in half,210
105260,2612346,4,i also this years ago and the only difference is that i just put the mushroom soup in the skillet with the pork chops and put a lid on it for about 45 minutes i had almost forgotten about this for the reminder,209
107621,203648,5,pie we loved it i didn t have enough fresh lemon juice so i added some lemon juice from concentrate that i had in the fridge it turned out,138

3010,175985,5,these are so to and so incredibly i did not have problems with the setting up either but as as a precaution i did add a tablespoon or so of butter into the karo syrup sugar mix i also had just over a cup of peanut butter left in the jar so i used more than one cup which it more creamy in the end my kids love it and will be added to my favorites,346

139812,81932,5,i this for a dinner party for my husbands birthday and it was a hit the crust was the best i ve had next time i would more crust because of my large pie plate i would also oil the pan to help release the pie i did not use the vanilla bean but did use the vanilla and banana extract i used the leftover half cup of cream whipped it with some sugar and put a dollop on each slice i will this again,395
35450,2107378,3,had this dish at a cookout and loved it so i came home and looked up this i do find that 4 lbs of grapes are waaaay too many so i used 2 lbs i also thought this used way too much brown sugar so the next time i it i used 1 2 cup still plenty sweet addictive dessert,264

486641,2001142648,5,i this last week amp it was so moist and i followed the exactly and i needed only 5 additional minutes to cook so 50 min because i used the end of a matchstick to test i don t know what happened to my toothpicks,211
108018,357323,5,this was a really curry i m not used to cooking with fish and my indian husband was skeptical when i used frozen fish he said he couldn t tell the fish wasn t fresh and he loved the curry i used about only half the water as we ate this with chapattis and not over rice,268
28817,634704,4,it was and next time i will sure i have more barbecue sauce in the house it could use a bit more,96
14220,37683,5,i used a 5 lb bottom round a bottle of dark mexican beer and added a large thinly sliced onion to the mix after cooking on low heat in my crockpot for 10 hours the shredding was i mixed some liquid smoke in with the hickory bbq sauce and honey this was a makes a sandwich on a kaiser roll i froze portions that were leftover,324
31901,604654,5,this is the best cobbler i ve ever had wow for me the sugar content is too extreme so i only sprinkled the peaches with sugar and didn t use a full cup of sugar for the batter fantastic,185
139822,269575,5,beautiful chilli jam the only diference i is to fry the garlic and onion first then process it along with everything else before cooking it all together i also use peanut oil instead of veg oil and i put abit of fish sauce or quality soy sauce to liven up the flavour even more this is one of the best asian stir fry sauces it is a favourite with everyone i have served it to i stirfry vegetables mushrooms tofu lettuce celery zucchini snow peas etc in peanut oil then i add this mix this sauce with abit of sweet soy sauce and mix it with the stirfried veg,557
2886,2002145256,5,so it did turned out goey like others just baked it longer and it was the best ever tip drop the temp to 275 300 and bake for almost 2 hours,140
71986,367879,5,i used pork sausage because it had less fat and fewer calories than the ground pork i also used about 3 parts sausage to 1 part beef oven baked is the way to go,160
55438,2002134109,5,there s nothing to dislike about pea and ham soup my only inputs these apply to my taste buds i find you really need at least 25 minutes to have the meat and tender doesn t hurt to sweat off the veges in the slow cooker uncovered first in some butter some chicken stock in place of 500ml of the water goes well i believe adding the pepper early is important you have to add it anyway and it s an under rated component of this dish salt is maybe different you won t need much but hey i like salt and i know i ll be adding some so i add a little at the start and top up later if needed finally let it sit for a day to let the flavours develop,640
114557,1802515607,5,what a i didn 039 t have 8 quot cake pans so i used 9 quot and decreased the baking time to about 22 24 mins i also added fresh strawberries to the frosting to it more like a strawberry lemonade frosting i couldn 039 t stop eating the it,237

223358,312363,4,this was so to throw together i it even easier by using frozen o brien potatoes whihc have diced onions and green peppers in replacement for the diced potatoes who has time to peel and dice potatoes based on the reviews from others i also added salt pepper and a little garlic powder to each layer because i used frozen potatoes and corn i baked it in a covered casserole dish for 1 hour and 15 minutes i didn t get any complaints from my picky family so i will be making this again p s the only reason i didn t rate this 5 stars is because i changes to the based on previous reviewers comments,594
238326,243711,4,very to prepare mine turned out a little drier than i would have liked so i m going to try again the taste was delish for posting,129

7572,217621,5,these cookies are fantastic soft and i couldn t find mint chocolate chips so i used about 8 or 9 pepperminy patties and the rest regular chocolate chips and these were still fantastic i bet they d be even more minty with the right chocolate chips my roomates loved these dannygirl,280

60777,326670,5,your choice of bbq sauce also tastes too i m eating one right now haha,70
12709,516556,5,slight modifications melted a few tablespoons of butter and added minced garlic and juice of a lime to that spooned under the skin and put some on the outside used salt and pepper but skipped the other spices lined the bottom of the pan with onion slices put some olive oil on the skin after an hour and basted a little later pan onions got carmelized and limey yum served with rice flavor wonderfully tender and an aroma that raises expectations that are not disappointed,472
187362,1483642,5,i had to add a lot more milk to it pourable but the taste was fantastic,71
4105,187349,3,this bread has a slight tangy sour dough flavor from another review i thought this might be due to using rancid flour i grind my own flour and the fresh flour still created this tangy after taste that sticks to your tongue long after finishing the top of my bread also deflated producing an unsightly product this bread did a perfect dough ball without me me having to babysit it it also has an excellent soft texture isn t full of holes and cuts beautifully,458
103746,415141,5,oh my gosh this was the best tasting meatballs ever i am so glad i checked online to see what others used for meatball sauces this is the best mmmmmmm goood this is a must try even my little kids who are picky loved them,220
131413,882321,5,out of all the truffles i have tried these have to be one of the best ever i loved them hubby was a bit skeptical about the coffee granules ground up with the sugar and cocoa for rolling in but he liked it after he tried it i love just the brownies too haha i guess i gained 2 recipes with this one i will be replacing my betty crocker boxed brownie mix with your for brownies i loved them,389
65768,1802675108,5,this is i slice thick chicken breast in half lengthwise and they were perfectly cooked in 5 6 minutes the only other change i was more cream and threw in a little bit of tony chachere 039 s creole seasoning perfection we eat in with brown rice and always extra chicken and rice i swear if you pack the chicken sauce and rice overnight in the fridge it tastes even better the next day lt br gt lt br gt you for this and chicken dish,431
179093,2001081920,1,these according to directions over indirect heat between 325 350 for 1 hr and 45 min on gas grill ribs were dry crisp burnt and overcooked from now on i will use the oven,170

447883,2056482,5,we added capers for some added flavor for the idea,50
129926,2546217,5,as a vegetarian i searched for an highly rated to for meat eating guests since i couldn t taste the dish as i went this looked it over a month ago then realized we had too much and froze it followed the exactly and prepared it right up until just before the baking step then wrapped it well and froze it pulled it out yesterday to thaw overnight in the fridge then cooked it tonight for 30 mins at 400 and served my dad who loves my but is a tough critic usually gives my dishes about an 8 to an 8 5 he gave this one a 9 5 my guests chose to eat more of this rather than eat one of my famous home desserts though they did eventually cram some of that in too this was an out of the park winner as told from the carnivores i will definitely definitely this again and based on the tremendous reactions cannot recommend this enough not only but a fabulous ahead frozen dish you so much deb,885
7188,9670,5,i have not this exact but have one very similar was about to post mine and found this one while checking the breadcrumbs mine call for are fresh also calls for reg tom sauce and 1 med ch onion the biggest difference is that mine calls for 3 4 cup of water to be mixed with the 2nd half of tom sauce otherwise it is identical it s a really meatloaf very moist and flavourful i usually serve it with noodles with the sauce from the meatloaf poured over top,454
103938,107081,4,this was a quick but hearty meal we ate it with a little cheese and cornbread i would add more beans next time i added diced green chiles instead of a jalapeno because that s what i had but will use a jap next time it was missing something and we can t put our finger on it but i ll update when i figure it out we will definitely play with the spices next time,360
62661,565910,5,and i followed the directions exactly using 5 habaneros i grew in my container garden ended up with 8 half pints wonderful flavor perfect levels of heat and sweet my whole family loves it for sharing,199

293366,29404,5,talk about old dog new trick i ve been hard cooking eggs more years than i care to admit to i m a grandmother and these just plain worked i like the preciseness i ve always done it by guess and by golly which invariably gave me green egg ring around the yolk my family prob doesn t even know that hard cooked eggs aren t supposed to have green rings i think that a little adjustment for cold eggs vs room temp be kept in mind for the posting,441
204332,366995,5,excellent i wasn t sure what pomegrante molasses was and i used pomegranate syrup instead i doubled the olive oil and did not use vegetable oil i was thrilled with the health aspects of this dish walnuts are high in omega 3 and pomegrantes are a source of anti oxidents very attractive pink color,296
17977,129177,5,fantastic i used half whole wheat flour and half bread flour my oil was olive oil i rolled out the first half very thin and let them rest for while the second half i rolled thicker and didn t let them rest we liked the second batch best i rolled them out on my counter without any added flour and cooked them in my ungreased cast iron skillet my whole family loved them and they rival the expensive bread i buy at my local lebonese grocer it went with my homemade hummus even my picky daughter and young grandchildren loved them this will be written down by hand in my book not many it there loved it and so much for sharing after some thought i finally realized that this bread is almost identical to flat out bread flat out is an expensive flat bread sold in most grocers at least around here in michigan love the stuff i ll be saving some serious money with this gem of a again,880
294620,445544,5,i ve been looking for a really cole slaw and now i can stop looking quick and loved it i let it set for 24 hours and it was perfect i cooked it with jo mama s world famous spaghetti for the post,194
391028,1217324,5,very scrumptious i didn 039 t have worcestershire 039 s sauce so i imagine it would be even yummier with it,107
61523,1574035,4,quick flavorful dish i took the suggestion of other reviewers and halved the seasonings in the rub i also added a box of green giant steamed veggies sugar snap peas potatoes and red peppers because i did not have any red peppers to mix with the pineapple i served this with hawaii sweet rolls loved it,301
373619,108807,4,i ve never been a big fan of red beans rice so i can t say that i m an expert but i liked this dish it was flavorful and fairly to,130
18154,63826,4,very i also used the onion and chive cream cheese to,52
161929,115523,5,my family loved this my roast was much larger 6 lbs or so but cooked to falling off the bone tender in 9 hours my only issue with the was that i ve never used this cut of meat before but it was onsale for cheap so i decided to try it when i unwrapped it the skin that was still on it really grossed me out the cut of meat as the name states is a shoulder and it looks like a shoulder i cut the skin and a lot of fat off of it there was still a ton of fat in the crock pot after it cooked i actually had to skim off some of the liquid probably because the roast was too big so i will reduce the amount next time also i put the potatoes in during the last 2 hours and they were very done so i don t know if they would have held up for the entire cooking time this family of 4 boys loved it so it s a keeper i just need to get by the look of it when it goes in the pot squeamish chef i guess,888
91270,43514,5,living in iowa this went over with guests it also leftovers and packed well for a teacher s lunch it s a keeper,111
485226,2607907,5,i just this frosting for my daughter s birthday cake we love it i did not have lemon extract so used a pinch of lemon peel and a drizzle of lemon juice instead and we also used a few drips of regular red coloring in place of the gel color the frosting is fluffy pink pretty and and it was to we will use this again,314
26091,190230,5,this was a huge hit this thanksgiving the only change i was i replaced half of the sugar with brown sugar to give it a richer more traditional flavor i would highly recommend this people actually waxed poetic about these and half were practically orgasmic over them i don t like sweet potatoes at all and i ate seconds nursedi you again for another excellent,358
79108,277462,3,honestly i thought this was just ok and my teenage son said the same i didn t see anything about this that stood out other than the ease of it and actually i don t think the ranch dressing mix had a place in here ranch has dill and tarragon and other assorted herbs in here and it drew away from the southwestern flavor of the soup i was looking for something unique and was a bit disappointed and don t think i ll be making this one again,439
123809,437137,5,these were hands down the best blueberry muffins i ve ever had vegan or not,75
90502,377397,5,this bread is one of the best i have ever tried in the bread machine and i have had a machine for 10 years the bread has a consistency and today i am going to try the bread dough cycle and monkey bread i am sure it will be outstanding and can t wait to sample it,262
42825,282125,5,yum my kids actually loved it and asked for more i didn t have crisp rice crumbs or any cereal so i fresh bread crumbs with 3 or 4 slices of whole wheat bread also added a touch bit extra poultry seasoning and thyme it was moist and i never moist chicken,254
73440,504780,5,omg sooo sifting really makes a difference,42
69089,439639,5,i really wish i was allowed to have at least one to give 10 stars it was i cut the chicken up added some frozen spinach and topped with mozzarella my boyfriend and i were very pleased for the its a keeper,204
114910,1803625703,5,excellent i love molcajete and now i am so excited to be able to it myself this is so i used low sodium bullion and the only other thing i did differently was to double the mushrooms you for the,194

70954,42895,5,this was a very i did add 1 2 teaspoon italian seasoning to the tomato ketchup topping i this in the morning did everything but bake it and put it in the fridge for my husband to take out and heat up for dinner it was a hit you,227
92204,1383534,2,definitely will not again this tasted like i was eating pasta with melted velveeta cheese that was what is was anyways it resembled outback s pasta and had the same consistency but the taste was not the same,207
154384,1179773,3,i did not feel this had a lot of taste i ended up pouring in half a jar of spaghetti sauce and then it was gobbled up not sure if i did something wrong,151
156133,1800355537,4,my daughter i this and it didn 039 t seem to cook very well it stayed sticky even after almost doubling the cook time i added a little more flour and tried again and it was a little better but still sticky the taste is fine they just don 039 t seem to cook as well as some of the others we 039 ve tried if you have a suggestion to fix i would love to have it we have cooked several of your recipes and they were,411
219477,1221043,5,i followed the for dinner tonight with excellent results substituted evvo for pam spray served it over roasted veggies fennel onion carrots italian parsley went light on the salt cheese eliminated seasoned salt which i replaced with a salt free paul prudhomme herb mixture roast veggies which have been coated with evvo in 350 degree oven place coated chicken tenders on top of the veggies continue to bake for another 30 minutes if you like gravy scrape the pan add salt free chicken broth thicken chicken is unbelievably tender and juicy,539
305221,226294,5,and this will become a mainstay at our house,44
27229,208818,5,these are really cookies and they couldn t be much easier to i used salted butter so i cut down on the salt and i had to bake them for 10 minutes in my oven i thought 2 tsp of vanilla seemed like a lot but thats how much i put in and it was perfect i tried both parchment paper and foil to line the cookie sheets i think the parchment paper works best the cookies seemed to release better for me,395
312651,886144,5,this pasta is superb me look like a pro its yet so flavorful it s the first time i cooked pasta with sour cream as an ingredient was doubtful at first until i tried it added more lemon juice to my liking delisioso,213
411314,2486322,5,loved how juicy and perfect the roast turned out loved how my oven did all the work without being on for very long hardest part was not peeking before 2 hours was up,165
24672,1190563,5,this was so to put together and it tasted everyone that tried it gave it rave reviews the only 2 small changes i would next time are making it in an 8 8 pan and i would only buy an 8 inch angel,193
404073,1815683,4,in my i trade the cheese for a native mexican quasi and the ranch for blue cheese crumbles it will that extra star,114
64751,77072,5,i used sugar free gelatin and pudding and it was very will certainly again to and keeps well in the refrigerator shirley,120
123522,134124,5,all three of my daughters have worked at the outback steakhouse and this is a true winner oops i forgot to give it a rating this is really pollyw,145
73166,577633,3,i did a chili contest and it to the last round then lost why it was to sweet but they did seem to think it was a different idea,127
24550,296546,4,after mixing all of the ingredients i found it to be a little too crumbly to scoop so i poured it into a pan and pressed it into bar cookies the kids loved them i did omit the raisins and nuts and add an extra cup of chocolate chips at the kids request don t know if that s what changed the texture i will another batch tonight according to the to bring to the in laws for passover for a super,393
438883,2000779435,5,just this for the first time and it is off the charts followed the strictly and wow this will definitely be going in our regular rotation of fall and winter dishes did i say it s,178
254206,2000166486,1,this is absolutely awful do not feed this to hummingbirds it gives them the same nutritional value it gives to humans they require vitamins and nutrients present in natural nectar and this will literally kill them but slowly and painfully,238
220287,477271,4,a friend of mine gave me a similar to this one it calls for miracle whip instead of the mayo and sugar this one is too for miracle whip lovers substitute the mayo and sugar yummo,178
42877,185142,5,such a meal shouldn t be so i added 1 2 can of diced potatos but other than that i followed the with 2 cups of chicken it was absolutely,136
88268,961910,5,being from louisville i can tell you that this is as close to an authentic hot brown as you can get some hot brown recipes call for cheddar cheese a real hot brown does not have cheddar cheese in it these are wonderful and very filling this particular is nearly identical to the one created by cissy gregg former columnist for the courierjournal who observed the chefs at the brown hotel to see just how a real hot brown is the only difference between this and cissy s is cissy s has 4 tablespoons whipped cream added to the sauce and it calls for 6 tablespoons each butter and flour rather than 1 3 cup each i also like to add sliced mushrooms to mine i also sometimes substitute turkey for the chicken,703
16702,146310,5,this is a very my 17 mo old especially likes it we had them with chokecherry syrup and the were,95
7667,407207,5,this was i omitted teh cayenne pepper and ginger and used mayo as suggested i pressed 3 cloves of fresh garlic into the mayo and mixed then dipped the chicken breast in that and then used italian seasoned breadcrumbs for posting,228
39911,52116,5,we used a london broil bbqed awsome,35
52680,787583,5,not the best i have had but they were pretty and everyone keeps bugging me to em so i m off to another double batch,115
131018,51931,5,i am reviewing the two ways one as written and one with a variation suggested by doug mc both reviews are for the pulled pork itself and its juices not the pulled pork with the bbq sauce since that would be totally subjective based on the type and brand of sauce preferred by each chef and a not review of the itself also i the variation one first as i forgot the ginger ale but had apples and apple cider vinegar on hand quot as is quot 4 stars prepared as directed it was and had i this before the variation i would have given it 5 stars as i 039 ve never pulled pork and wouldn 039 t know any different the was and but lacked some flavor and didn 039 t wow me like the variation i used pork shoulder butt that 039 s what the packaging said that i purchased from kroger i couldn 039 t find a 4 pound roast so i bought an 8 pounder and doubled the i 039 m not sure what flavoring the ginger ale gave it but i couldn 039 t taste it i cooked on low for 11 hours and the meat shredded easily was super tender and juicy like the variation we also took out the onions after cooking shredding also we did not add the bbq sauce to the meat and simmer in the crockpot instead i put the shredded pork back in the crockpot with its juices and let it soak it up on warm adding bbq sauce to the meat and simmering is just not how my husband eats it in the south plus if i had eaten it using my husband s sauce mixed throughout i would have given it 2 stars i don t like his sauce lol served for thanksgiving dinner with mashed potatoes gravy from the pulled pork juices and roasted asparagus my husband definitely gives this a thumbs up and likes it so this is a keeper quot variation quot 5 stars instead of the ginger ale i wanted to try doug s recommendation of 1 cup apple juice and 1 cup apple cider since i had that on hand did not have smoke flavor and did not use it everything else in the original stayed the same i have a juicer so i juiced a granny smith apple for fresh apple juice i also used braggs organic apple cider i poured in 1 cup of each i put mine in the crockpot when i left for work around 6 30 am with onions on top and on the bottom by time i came home at 4 30 pm the meat was falling off the bone i turned it off and pulled the pork with a fork it was so tender and juicy i couldn t help myself and ate some without the bbq sauce it had a tang to it maybe the vinegar did that i don t know or the apples but it had a different flavor than just the ginger ale it was still i gave some to my husband but he didn t like the onions because that s not how they do it in the south where he s from so i removed the onions and put the meat back in the crockpot and into the juices since he is from the south and usually is served his pulled pork plain with the sauce on the side so he can pour it over the meat on his sandwich that is exactly how i served it for dinner i heated the bbq sauce he used famous dave s devils spit sauce he has always hated everything i have ever cooked in the crockpot so he wasn t hopeful that it would be on the contrary he loved it instead of a traditional thanksgiving dinner this year he asked for pulled pork in the crockpot excellent variation to the original will definitely will be making this again,3246
155580,1146814,5,who woudda thunk it so so but soooo,35
19417,957383,3,to follow this is my first time to a mocha muffin but this came out not quite mocha tasting muffin but it was just need a little more taste i also doubled the coffee and choco ingredient i also advice others to bake for 20 min or less,234
10653,194207,5,this was a lot like chili s burgers i substituted oatmeal finely processed doubled the garlic and basil and we grilled them perfect for the vegetarians in our family for a cookout,179
219423,2001284563,5,okay i ve never cooked lamb before or lamb lion this was only had 1 5 pounds though try to smaller i over cooked meat but so tender and you for,143
150141,111075,5,whoever judy is she sure knows how to broccoli salad this is one of those crunchy munchy salads that is a meal in itself and it was i did change the dressing ingredients to 1 2 cup mayo 2 t apple cider vinegar and only 1 t sugar which was plenty enough sweetness for our tastebuds,280
181143,254805,5,super and i added some fresh garlic,35
79669,348341,4,this would be best over rice or pasta i think smelled looked pretty unattractive but then a lot of things do when they come from a crockpot and some awesomely tender and sweet potatoes i think next time i would add more chicken since the chicken was a little overpowered by the sweet potatoes but then i had big sweet potatoes definitely something i will again it is very filling so i am thinking i could get 6 servings out of it if it were put over rice or noodles,465
452580,1806667,5,very the oats gave it an unexpected texture and flavor i never would have thought of that for posting looking forward to seeing what else you will be posting in the future,171
259573,2002044420,3,i do the exact opposite i bring a pot to boil and then lower the eggs gently into the boiling water let sit for ten minutes and remove from heat wait ten minutes and pour cold water on them to peel every time no matter if the eggs are fresh or have been sitting out for a few days,280
74629,876408,5,this was at first i was wondering about the cheese on top and i wasn t sure if it was going to go together however it came out wonderfully a really hearty meal,159
130915,114105,5,very salad i omitted the kiwi s since i didn t have any one hand my men have all decided they like jicima,105
400163,403472,5,i thought this was really and very and quick to put together my kids liked it so that is 2 thumbs up,100
210212,1315973,5,just this and it is i followed the exactly as shown next time i will try half whole wheat flour and flaxseed i will this again,126
15507,828499,4,i thought this was very i added sliced fresh mushrooms at step five and i was super glad i did it turned out i had thick chicken breasts so it wasn t quite done in the amount of time the called for the broth was reducing too much so i just added a little water so the chicken could finish simmering,298
304719,500849,5,i hesitantly this after seeing it in better homes and garden it actually was a huge hit with my co workers and family they said it s their new favorite i used a bag of frozen cherries and did not even bother to thaw them out the cherry chocolate combo is i used bittersweet chocolate chips for the chocolate portion,315
114907,1108463,5,i absolutely love this i ve it twice now and i am planning on making it again today for an event tomorrow it is really and very rich if you don t like chocolate and you don t like peanut butter stay away from this however i love them both and this is just maybe i am using the wrong size spring form pan but if you the as indicated it won t all fit and when it bakes it will bubble over so be careful today i am going to use this and two separate cheesecakes i didn t care for the sour cream topping so instead i do a chocolate drizzle the crust is wonderful however you should have some left over i love crust don t get me wrong it s one of the best parts of the cheesecake but too much and it just gets hard to eat overall my absolute favorite,745
21706,332670,5,this was very my whole family loved it the only problem i had was the sides being burnt you for posting,103
79275,1630385,5,i was looking for the perfect lemon butter sauce and i ve found it i did several changes i didn t use knorr aromat seasoning i used beef bouillon granules and found it very salty so i added some water and a little sugar i also used a little bit of rice wine instead of dry white wine because i didn t have it i also added red pepper flakes and sprinkled salt on the fillets my father took one bite and ate the entire dish,421
369823,662323,4,these are pretty the only issue i have with them is they rose really beautifully and i expected them to sink of course but they sunk in quite considerably not pretty at all but nonetheless a little on the sweet side goes well with hot tea,238
317078,2001161119,5,i loathe looking at reviews amp seeing people say quot i subed this for that quot and what not follow the or don t review i have this many times over the last few years as written and it is fabulous no subs no nonsense stick to the way it s written and you will have the best lo mein that you ve ever tasted,307
416288,848957,5,this is the way my mom always it i never knew there was another way and everyone didn t do this until hubby said with water yuk this is the only way to it,154
394512,306193,5,bit hit with my 17 year old son i added about 3 4 c sour cream and 3 c cheese total,83
346999,1182495,5,this was definitely will again,30
3579,19166,5,this is just flat out ours took a little longer to bake but ovens are quirky creatures sometimes and it still came out perfect we topped it with haagen dazs dulce de leche ice cream and had a very hard time not going back for seconds,233
247637,426229,5,this last night with 1 medium sized turkey thigh for the 2 of us used 1 3 of the remaining ingredients baked for about 70 min total dh and i both loved the flavor for a dinner thats both and economical,201
32618,2029658,5,i have used this many times it 039 s absolutely excellent my wife and i love these things i usually the full and freeze them in 3 or 4 bags then during the week when i 039 m feeling lazy i buy some store bought pasta sauce and simmer the meatballs in it for about it hour it thaws out the meatballs and add some flavor the the sauce seriously stop reading reviews and go some meatballs,385
21695,671577,5,this soup was wonderful some changes because everyone in the family is not a big bean fan i only used 1 large can of pinto beans used corn instead of hominy i also added a little extra water everyone loved it my dh who usually doesn t like this raved about it as well as all of my kids will definitely again,307
91577,252536,5,this is an drink,16
221217,808535,5,this was the first time for me to and i think also eat couscous it was so you for this and i will be making this more often from now on,135
51833,345511,5,this was excellent i actually substituted beef rice a roni for the rice and used salsa instead of the chili sauce only because i had it in the cupboard but my dh and ds both loved it for the,190
393079,220020,4,this tonight but on top of the stove i used rigatoni and added ground beef putting the other ingredients in the pan once the meat was browned i also added dried onion flakes to the meat while it was browning once i added the tomato sauce and water i took a hint from saucylicious and added a small can of tomato sauce with an equal quantity of water to slightly imitate the tomato juice she uses also added mixed italian spices some marjoram and some garlic salt i added the rigatoni once the sauce was boiling i used a deep chicken trying pan with a tight fitting lid and kept it all over a low flame until the pasta was fully cooked stirring occasionally to keep it from burning one of was done i turned the fire off and sprinkled the mozzarella all around before putting the lid back on so it would all melt it was really but i would add more seasoning it was a little flat but better that than too much spice,912
1078,55827,5,absolutely fabulous very fresh tasting i could eat this stuff by the gallon wow,79
18803,178782,5,i really enjoyed this soup it was comfort for me today i used some mckay s chicken seasoning contains no chicken instead of vegetable broth and half the amount of basil the mckay s is salty so i didn t need to add any salt enjoy,228
38065,196470,5,this was so we had this for christmas breakfast everyone raved about it,71
74214,1146923,5,i used this for my first crack at chicken marsala and wow was it i did add a little flour and extra butter into the finished sauce to get a slightly thicker outcome but even with my fiddling my husband has announced we no longer need to go out for italian anymore lol,267
37270,463282,5,these were very dh dd and i all enjoyed them i used the cheesy taco seasoning as i didn t have any regular on hand i used whole chicken tenders instead of nugget too i served them with mashed potatoes and corn and it rounded out to be a fast weeknight meal junebug for the,272
20713,600761,5,this was a huge hit with my kids i had to reduce the roughly by 1 3 as that is all the powdered milk i had even with a rough estimation of ingredients the kids really liked it this was by far the least chemical tasting chocolatey hot chocolate that i ve had in a long time,272
125462,945344,5,i have two of these this summer i use nofat and sugar free pudding and cream cheese sugar free cool whip too my family loved it,127
187260,620081,5,this was soooo cheese and garlic are just a few of my favorites to cook with and this showcased them together wonderfully the combination was perfection i will definitely be making this again you for such a,206
363958,318252,3,holy salt i love salt but this was a bit much it overpowered the rest of the flavors next time i ll either halve the seasoning salt or omit it all together because there was flavor there under the salt 3 stars for now but i hope to bump it to 4 when i reduce the amount of salt,277
8605,176088,5,this is the same i use all the time and it is the best,54
196101,1284665,4,taking heed to the other comment i went conservative with the salt and started with 1t i added however and ended up with somewhere between 1 75 and 2t being lazy i didn t drain reheat the vinegar but continuously turned the mixture as the cabbage started to slightly wilt it did produce a lot to drain which i did once i achieved the desired texture and taste slightly wilted tangy was and it s pretty close to the restaurant version also added carrot slivers which added color,477
128120,373083,5,loved this i ve the other one similar to this but loved the addition of nuts i used sliced almonds i also liked that there was no added butter the only thing i did differently was to spread some all fruit spread on the bottom layer of crescent rolls,249
37380,211309,4,this was very think next time i will double the filling and add way more pears,78
91735,2001603645,5,i these last night for dinner ran home and put these in the crock pot on my lunch break it took me 30 minutes from start to finish getting these in the crock pot and ready to turn on i doubled the sauce as most suggested and did add a little water to the sauce to it thinner i used regular green cabbage and it 10 rolls i cooked on low for 6 hours and then left on warm setting for 1 hour while i ran out and picked up kids form practice these turned out the sauce was somewhat watery but i didn t have time to do the cornstarch thing to thicken it up since we were too hungry to wait but it still tasted my husband who doesn t really like stuff too sweet thought the sauce tasted he really liked it i have cabbage rolls in the past and i would say these turned out better and much easier to just throw in the crockpot and go will definitely again,847
46860,601181,4,these cookies tasted but they spread out a lot i m going to try using shortening to keep them a little more compact i was pleased though because other oatmeal raisin recipes i ve tried turned out sickeningly sweet but these were just the right touch of sweetness,262
63058,63024,5,however i did eliminate the flour and lemon juice and it still was very,71
41421,1741243,4,this is one of my go to recipes this time i used regular sausage canned spinach cheese bread and rehydrated home dried cottage cheese instead of milk etc i hadn 039 t it for a while and could not find it in my box or in the main collection i contacted the site for help got nothing i actually knew all of the main ingredients but used winter squash as my key words instead of pumpkin well pumpkin is a winter squash for those who don 039 t know other types of winter squash even processed and sold as canned pumpkin varieties are so similar,540
26249,169515,2,i had high hopes for this with so many rave reviews i must admit that i used boneless breasts though to cut down on the fat so the chicken didn t have the flavour from the pre roasting like this it was very ordinary the chicken itself was tasteless and the sauce needed extra zest and i am not a lover of spicy sorry,316
233313,588863,4,this needs more complete directions for the novice bakers and that s why it gets just four stars i form the cookies into 1 balls press once with a fork before baking also a flavorful peanut butter like jif works well for these cookies for posting,246
146036,627045,5,this is a winner i m notorious for changing things up a bit so instead of parsley i added some rosemary and thyme i also added some slivered almonds that i had leftover from another which added a extra layer of texture and put some swiss cheese on top worked so well with this you i will definitely be making this again,319
4065,809083,5,this is now a family hit love the cinnamon taste we these every week,68
293455,911074,5,i just had these cookies at a friends house and they were outstanding i can t wait to them,90
68597,487909,5,i loved these but agree to only use half the caramel it was a little too much but they were,91
126959,154588,4,i these as described but only used 1 2 tsp of ground cloves that was all i had left and i used treacle instead of molasses as i believe that is the usual conversion for non americans the only molasses we get here is blackstrap molasses and i think that would be a bit strong these are if you like chewy cookies and i hope they will stay that way when they ve cooled some more the smell of them baking reminds me of an indian grocery which is a thing the only change i might in future is to increase the amount of ginger double as it s overpowered by the allspice update these do retain chewy texture for at least 3 days and they freeze well,640
258777,190402,4,and like you mention it turned out very moist i these into cupcakes and while everyone enjoyed them they were surprised to hear that they were supposed to be orange flavored for some reason the orange taste did not come through on these cupcakes at all that being said it is still a and i will be making them again,314
136822,34834,4,very i think the only thing that kept this from being 5 stars was our personal tastes we like things more spicy so i think next time i ll double the spices but we loved the blend of flavors very different and to i a few small changes i doubled the chicken added extra green chiles and used regular spaghetti because it was all i had the spaghetti took a little longer to cook than the vermicelli would have but we prefer it over thinner pastas for sharing a,457
98395,94775,5,having never cooked a whole chicken before i thought this looked promising it was wonderful the meat had wonderful flavor was so juicy and fell right off the bone this is the only way i cook whole chickens and have also carried to over to a turkey breast what a fast way to a homemade dinner,291
16705,104600,5,it took me two days to find all the crevices the sauce seeped into and i loved every minute of it so did my daughter and her family and my sister this is a and and yummmmmmmmmmmm lee,182
52809,1863494,4,wow that was i used this to as mini meatloves in a muffin pan a little on the sweet side but that could have been my ketchup very moist but not watery it filled up a 12 muffin pan perfectly cooked at 350 for 15 minutes subbed corn chex for the breadcrumbs and added some green bell pepper with the carrots,305
213952,1185662,5,totally the only change i was to add more liquid because i like my pancakes a little more on the thin side this is a keeper for sure,132
242066,1214889,5,i was stuck for dinner tonight i thought i had purchased the marinade i use normally for my baked chicken breasts but i didn t and realized this as i was prepping dinner tonight what a i ve used similar for baking a whole chicken but never thought to use this for boneless chicken breast i followed the used season salt pepper and garlic salt since i was using so much salt i decided to use unsalted butter came out perfect and got rave reviews my fiance said it tasted like roast chicken and went for seconds and thirds paired it with broccoli in garlic and evoo and 2 1 potato sweet potato mash yum,600
83123,248009,4,we had this as part of our chrismas eve appetizers we only used 8 oz of neufchatel and a bit less than 1 3 cup of light sour cream and it was almost too rich next time we ll use a little less neufchatel to promote the flavor of the smoked salmon but the mixture of flavors is excellent had never thought to add capers to a smoked salmon dip but it was will again,362
23234,313633,5,deliscious for posting,22
370761,2066263,4,yum it was very refreshing d i thought it needed a splash more lime but that s just me i can t wait to this again syd,117
244423,2447261,3,this was alright nothing spectacular but i couldn t stop at one piece though it wasn t sweet enough i guess or banana flavored enough for me to eat just one piece and say awww that was,184
213089,1341285,1,maybe you should list exactly which brand of white vinegar mustard that was on your i tried it it does not taste even close to outback s version too much oil,157
319796,1305922,5,i was worried about not putting garlic in with the onions like i normally would do and i would never in a million years have tried putting basil in thai but it was i didn t add the water and i thickened it a bit at end tofu would have been in it as would a bit more vege i only had 4 cups my non vege husband also liked it,322
68946,523671,4,these were very i only had one banana and i added about a tablespoon of milk to the batter more moist they were to and i will definately use this again,151
43850,344716,4,i had never boiled pumpkin seeds before baking them before and i was really surprised at what a difference it so much for posting this tip,138
2306,693933,5,i love this dish my mom it all the time while i was growing up and it was always a fav now i it for my husband and its his favorite as well usually when i it i use a little extra broth and let the veggies cook longer so they aren t crunchy and i always use an extra egg yum yum everyone that tries this dish loves it,316
35628,437549,3,i liked it but it was a little plain for me so i added a little garlic powder and that a big differance now i will it much more often,133
339338,1099625,5,this was a new way to cauliflower it was pretty steamed all in one head instead of in pieces the sauce was very even though we used a buttery spread instead of butter the family enjoyed it,188
296855,1347424,5,this is first saw it at a pampered chef party and decided to try it i it for a church dinner and everyone loved it to and,121
121350,1334867,2,definitely not the same consistency as the hale koa muffins they are missing some sweetness too,95
349598,1542289,5,wow these muffins are very and very first time baking muffins at all and i will be sticking with these forever kids loves em i loved em and dh loved them and thats all that matters you so much i hope more people them so you can keep getting these ratings,254
96521,887970,4,i used youghurt instead of sour cream walnuts and splenda instead of sugar i liked it my son not so much so for him i will use regular sugar next time,150
98867,422110,5,june 25 2009 i tried this and it is as as everyone says my family loved it and we gave a loaf to the older couple next door the lady wanted the i showed her how to use her computer a present from her grandson which was gathering dust to check out recipezaar s recipes this opened a whole new world for her to one loaf of the world s best cinnamon raisin bread you katie,369
154348,495021,5,i thought this was i also diced and boiled carrots and yellow squash it was to die for the only thing i was confused about was if it makes 12 buscuit cups how can it be divided into 5 servings but aside from that i give this a rave review,238
128132,1190532,5,this was really for the short time i have been cooking i never thought of using bisquick for making oven fried chicken i will be difinately be making this again,160
24678,552864,5,oh my this was so in so many ways we had this last week and first bite my honey bunch said he like it and that is a big plus i was excited to get up and have leftover for lunch the next day lol i used penne pasta and doubled the chicken as it was what was left from a rotisserie one the day before i used just a wee bit of bread crumbs with the parmasean cheese on top this filled an 8x11 pan perfectly we kinda on purpose had chicken today for leftovers tomorrow yeaaa me you for such an wonderful,498
65458,358095,5,this was fabulous i used the more as a guideline because i a was too lazy to a crust and b didn t have all the ingredients i used fresh basil plus fresh dill and a prepared crust i used ham instead of bacon and green onions instead of white but what i ended up with was i had some leftover and mini crustless quiche in a muffin pan which will be a breakfast in the morning,372
44590,151541,5,i this for a bar be que with friends and everyone loved them the apples and brown sugar added a sweet flavor that was enjoyed by all,132
70239,9172976,5,i christmas breakfast with this my only change was adding diced ham for a protein component it was fabulous everyone loved it and i have already had requests to it every christmas and sunday my daughter is making it for her family tonight stuff,244
59829,605340,5,everyone loved it i used a lot more than 2 cups of salad greens probably more like 4 6 still plenty of dressing and fruits and nuts per serving,143
47041,16814,4,the dip was and refreshing but the yogurt became runny shortly after the dip was taken out of the refrigerator perhaps straining the yogurt before preparing the dish would help,176
99156,467341,3,this was a little chicken,25
89204,226462,3,loved that this was so to throw together we wrapped this up along with lime rice and salsa in tortilla shells i wish we could ve enjoyed this as much as everyone else has but it just didn t seem to have much flavor will try again adding some spice to the mix jen,262
91644,154832,5,fantastic flavor and to i cooked it an additional 5 minutes just to be sure and it was perfect,94
141018,390259,3,close to greek i ve tried that calls for apples pine nuts cinnamon wine if you want an old newfie look up farce on this website spicy but gooooood,146
33568,176843,5,everything about these beans was just right the color the aroma the flavor i them for a dinner party and everyone raved for a fantastic,135
112074,137231,5,i ve these several times now and after a few yet messy mishaps i ve finally perfected the technique my cheese kept bursting out of the coating before it was brown enough so i cranked up the heat to 400 and it worked perfectly also i had accidently doubled the spices once and dh said they were the best cheese sticks he had ever had that time definitely resturant quality i will be making these again and again,410
220346,548090,4,these are the cookies my mom too i ve tried a few others and have since lost them i tripled the because there are 3 of us i used 1 round cookie dough scoop and my batch 12 cookies i will be making even twice that many next time these are i like only a hint of peanut butter flavor so i will use a little less next time for an old time favorite,343
78921,1098997,5,so so so sooooo i didn t use the ice cubes just it a shake i added a little whipped cream garnished with a little chocolate syrup,129
22176,1586649,5,yum yum this was so and so the chicken broth really added extra flavor i love recipes you can ahead of time and leave leftovers this is a keeper,144
196320,54728,4,these are really though perhaps a little sweeter than i would like i ll use less sugar next time maybe 1 2 cup each type i them with freshly shelled pecans instead of walnuts i used half as many choc chips as the stated 2 cups seemed a huge amount and substituted white choc chips instead of the brown which i think really suited the blond nature and flavours of this the blondies are very moist and cakey in texture i was expecting something much denser especially with only one egg but i guess that is the moistness of the bananas for sharing dh loves them this is a keeper,575
109075,2000396029,5,very crab cake recipes,22
36091,2002399300,5,excellent salad i ve been making this same salad for years now and everyone seems to love it there is never any leftovers,121
288876,1268464,3,this was definetly i dont know that it reminded me quite of an actual white castle but it was very and eaten quickly,116
181617,150727,5,truer words were never spoken i did a half and got about 2 dz decent size cookies could have been more i ate them almost as fast as they came out of the oven i can t wait to share with my co workers of course i will give credit where credit is due chef dee of course i reviewed this for camera less chef fall 2006 chef dee for sharing your family,346
25273,59532,5,what a wonderful idea and non toxic as well my son loved these,62
95569,401886,5,for a i used sweet baby ray s bbq sauce i cooked it on high for three hours and shredded the chicken after two hours the was and for a weekend meal i will definitely it again,174
41977,478964,5,excellent bread texture very to family loved it this is a keeper,64
45939,608913,5,the best mac n cheese and also very to,38
286452,146426,4,this was a summer meal i didn t use the basil as i just don t care for it and in place of the pine nuts i used sunflower seeds the tomatoes had a lovely flavor i really enjoyed and i m not a huge tomato fan i think you could easily use any other pasta also,256
94087,139930,5,i these last christmas and i will be making them again this christmas they are i loved the orange flavor in the cookie almost like the cranberry bread that i really like just a little sweeter,191
108460,2020149,5,i this bread cake a couple of times now we love it,50
63665,327115,5,this was wonderful i love anything cinnamon so this was a treat i it on the stove top and it a very large batch this is also very warm with cream after smelling it as i it i couldn t wait for it to cool off,206
198398,398160,5,this one is a keeper one of the reasons this cake appealed to me was that for a rich dessert it is relatively low in calories the only problem is that it was so i had two servings i followed the precisely but didn t decorate the cake with candied violets for the,262
27210,431716,4,these were pretty i used olive oil instead of the veg oil i think i will cut back on the lemon pepper next time it isn t my favorite seasoning they were a tender and not at all dried out which is a huge plus i will these again i am sure for a kate,247
118242,2720797,5,wish i d found a like this 30 years ago i m never buying a brownie mix again i did a couple changes adding both walnuts and chocolate chips and a splash of hazelnut liquor total baking time in my oven was 25 minutes on covection,228
271829,2002335608,5,i tried this for the first time last night and i love it i used a large pyrex bowl and heat safe spatulas yes the bowl gets hot she warns you of that in the use oven mits to handle i used the 3 min process and it turned out so well i 3 batches of different flavors in less time than i ever imagined i usually only get thru one batch as it s so time consuming i don t want to more you for the my next adventure is microwave peanut brittle,437
80156,2001191572,5,love love love the just want to eliminate or reduce the sugar factor any tips on what i should do i replaced the molasses with pure maple syrup and it was yum,158
20111,427781,3,i used shredded chicken in this and substituted 1 cup of jack cheese for some of the cheddar i also omitted green peppers i don t like them otherwise we loved it,161
173678,1800051920,4,this was very and very however i can 039 t give it all five stars because i will change a couple of things next time i 039 ll use an entire pound of sausage sweet italian turkey instead of just a half will also add more than a half cup of pasta i eyeballed it until it looked right i also sprinkled parmesan directly onto my bowl of soup after i had salted and peppered it really a quick meal,392
151749,700945,5,this is the second time i this cake the first was but i think i over whipped the batter and then cooked it too long both times it did not take 1 to 1 1 2 hrs to bake the first was a little over done in 1 hr at 375 the second i didn t mix as long and you tell the batter was a little more runny and i baked at 350 again it was done in 1 hr and was not over done i pulled the small loaf out at 45 mins i had a tipsy cake from jack daniels at our local liquor store about 2 years ago and it was and it me start looking for a i don t remember if this is what it tasted like but this cake is outstanding,598
89921,183968,5,since i ve never had applebee s i dont know if they taste like theirs or not but they certainly are the whole family loved them,127
198942,179827,5,this is a seasoning mix i just added my own meat veggies and beans and a chili that was seasoned perfectly this is definitely a keeper that will be used over and over again for sharing,184
32839,90205,4,i bet thses are but i tried to double the batch and they turned out really plain and they took forever to cook,110
158977,1180452,5,d e l i c i o u s for shearing everyone try these,49
397818,212801,2,very cute idea but instructions were not the best i had a difficult time getting the pretzels in or even to stick because the treats had cooled hardened i didn t have the time or patience to it work,198
16373,17608,5,this was really i used the sauce as a dip and had a ton left over probably enough for 3 batches of these everyone raved you diana this is a super very dessert,158
312992,2000497252,1,terrible sauce nothing like hoisin,34
56282,456158,5,very roast i overcooked by an hour i dont know what i was thinking still turned out although dry due to my dumbness i poured jucies from roaster in pot and boiled to a gravy was already very thick so i didnt have to add anything still and very pleased with roast i used a 2 5 lb beef roast and shredded when it was done for,323
121105,885483,3,wonderful flavor but it didn t set up with only one minute of cooking time cooked for nearly 30 minutes to achieve a jelled consistency after it cooled will again but with extended cooking time,193
60350,2001476916,5,followed the to a t except i doubled everything came out perfect,64
116882,196296,5,i would rate this higer if i could this was a the fish was perfectly cooked and was really complimented by the sauce i don t usually like fish curries so i m so glad i decided to try this i will be making this again and again it s going right into my 5 cookbook,261
204109,743941,5,them the first time so no trouble very,38
158951,1345989,5,i have this twice now and the we have loved it both times i have also just the pepper sauce w other marinades and also used just this marinade by itself both halfs of this are because they taste so well together as well as are enough to stand alone i have some steaks marinading right now and cannot wait to the pepper sauce tonight to eat with them i have yet to find a of yours i don t love kitten,399
90714,124404,5,oh bri22 this is just wonderful living in norway i have no idea what bullhead fish is so i used cod filets it was absolutely wonderful other than that i followed the as submitted with it i prepared something of what americans call augraten potatoes and grated raw carrots plus sliced european cucumbers in a sweet sour brine yum no left overs for dh and me you so much for this idea on how to prepare fish,405
283434,1031614,5,i tried this dish at a friends house it was green and gluggy and she wouldn t share the never mind coz this was my boys aged 4 and 6 loved it and so did the hubby i fried red chilli flakes in oil and mixed it in the serving bowls for my husband and i to it spicier you so much for sharing this,293
32731,111997,5,so and so basically the same ingredients i had been using in my baked spaghetti but the difference was the layering who d have known that layering as opposed to mixing it all up would such a difference the only i ll use from now on did i mention quick,251
50495,178116,5,this has been a family favorite for years it is on a cold day and to fix i flatten the biscuits slightly and cut into strips before dropping into the chicken we think it is easier to eat this way,195
231351,250835,5,this was excellent directions were clear and to follow the results were you1 we will be making this again,105
138222,144021,5,breakfast choice during busy holiday s or for sleepovers since i can get the kids to eat it i don t typically add any of the vegetables i m sure they d be with it as well even it over vacation with another family it was my day to breakfast it fed all 10 of us yum,263
22348,1229449,5,doubled this as well used brandy on hand instead of cognac start to finish five minutes fantastic sure there is plenty of fresh baguette handy you ll need it to soak up every last drop of this delectable sauce,209
513472,1802568568,5,what a ahead breakfast so even after heating up in the microwave and that 039 s hard to find if you want to be a tad healthier you might consider swapping the chorizo for vegetarian chorizo i haven 039 t tried it yet but i definitely will since i have a few vegetarian friends who i 039 m sure will love this,308
90143,94422,5,i a similar except on the stove top follow same instructions except at the end i add some cornstarch to me cream to thicken it up then i add cooked egg noddles to the whole pot and a cool name everyone always enjoys cooked on the stove top cooks in about an hour,262
88350,1901869,5,i used mahi mahi because for some reason we have a freezer full of it and i wanted to try something different from my usual grilling with salt pepper or topping with an mango chutney that 039 s too i doubled the fresh lemon because i think mahi mahi requires a bit more than other fish also doubled the tabasco loved it so baked perfectly in 12 minutes i added a picture but probably should have broiled it a bit longer but really the picture didn 039 t do the look justice as it was really pretty i 039 m thinking i may try this next time with a side of mango jalapeno chutney for color,587
141983,1573372,5,i am a horrible cook but even i can this and it s i use a little more garlic and add spinach and mushrooms,106
69437,134536,5,this is my new favorite i found this to be an excellent blend of flavors and color it s a change from tomato based sauce and cheese based sauce that commonly accompany pastas my family loved it as did i you for sharing,218
69725,1803018654,5,omg omg omg omg this is soooooooooooooo that is all,51
99237,153623,4,this was and tastey i didn t have old bay so i used cajun sesoning as a previous reviewer suggested i liked the cracker crumbs on the outside it added a texture to the finished product,184
39304,50679,3,i have this but i don t put cinnamon in it it changes the taste and instead of vanilla i put cherry extract in it excellent,123
39368,708214,4,i used this cake to my colour cake added photos and it was ok it wasn t as as some other white cakes i have tried but it wasn t bad i found it a bit dry tasting but that might have more to do with the size of the eggs i used than the itself i will try it again with larger eggs,277
330246,979648,5,this is the best flavour fried chicken it was even better cold merci france,75
46771,45651,5,dana these cookies were i them with the cranberries and they were gone i a second batch without cranberries but added raisins and they too disappeared for such a,161
105142,47723,4,i like my spanish rice with meat so i browned and drained 1 pound of hamburger in a skillet then followed the as directed in the skillet with the meat it was but could have been a little spicier for my taste i spiced it up with a little mexican hot sauce,254
62698,788814,5,this apple crisp was absolutely wonderful i used 5 fuji apples added a tiny splash of lemon juice to them and doubled the topping as suggested suggestion it was a little soupy but i think it was because we couldn t wait and dove in before it had a chance to cool and set properly i this last night and it s already gone i ve been commanded begged to it again tonight love love love this i m off to start peeling apples you maeeast 2 9 09 i used 3 4 cups of blackberries the 3rd time i this and followed the directions exactly came out yet again one last note i always use margarine instead of butter and it still comes out wonderful again me,641
447127,1803670857,5,i this twice about 2 years ago having chicken loving guests for sunday dinner and i am going to it again i remember how everyone enjoyed it beautifully moist with a delicate tarragon taste the sauce was lovely i cut the lemon by half to be nearly undetectable i would recommend this even for a novice read the and instructions 1st think of it in logical terms and dive in you 039 ll receive accolades enjoy,406
243446,2563541,5,these were very to and were i the dough in my bread machine so it was even easier my husband from venezuela says they are perfect and keeps begging me to more,158
105202,814629,5,my mom makes the best chicken salad but when i asked her for the she was not able to give me exact measurements she is the kind of cook who just puts ingredients together and adjusts until it looks and tastes right so i began a quest to find a that uses the same ingredients she does this one came the closest so i decided to it today i must say it tastes very similar i am pleased with the results my mom doesn t use lemon juice in hers so i only put a small amount in what i i reduced the mustard to 1 1 2 teaspoons i also added a dash of salt and omitted the onion personal preference i chopped the chicken eggs and celery in my processor because i don t like mine chunky you patrish for helping me recreate my mom s beloved chicken salad,741
161324,353492,5,loved the consistency i adore thick soups so with the sour cream stirred in i will this again and again and again,113
3470,598340,4,this was and to however a bit on the rich side for me i think it might have been the swiss cheese so ill leave that out next time i shredded my chicken breast with a fork once they were cooked i agree with a previous review the stuffing was a bit mushier than i prefer the 4 stars are for how it was but i think i will a few adjustments,336
108364,2002043471,5,this tonight and it was delish this is a keeper the chicken was crispy on the outside and moist inside,102
129762,609582,5,my neices ages 12 17 baked goods as gifts every christmas well for the last 3 anyway this is one of the items they include it is always the first thing to go they always said it was an well what do you know i love these things,226
81314,2510579,5,i tried this a couple weeks used boneless skinless breasts its as as any restaurant chicken vesuvio here in chicago if you like chi ken v you wont be disappointed,162
390327,1424356,3,hmmm so so as written i was kicking myself for succumbing to the fake spice of lemon pepper maybe i will try it again minus that ingredient and try something like cilantro instead or lemongrass the lemon pepper i bought goes in the garbage right now,249
315037,1650338,3,this is definitely the best for producing crisp canned jalapenos i it according to the but have found that the 24 tablespoons of salt has to be a misprint i have found this at another website and it calls for 2 1 2 tablespoons of salt instead of 24 tablespoons if you want crisp peppers this is the only that i have found that works we love them except for the salt,365
27195,183445,5,loved it didn t change a thing flavor,37
54351,2001421476,5,i these for my husband who kept whining for oatmeal cookies i m not a huge fan but i them because i love him i actually googled quot best oatmeal cookie quot and this one came up even i loved them he said they were the best he had ever had will certainly them again even before he starts whining,295
38641,42586,5,this is an absolutely my husband actually argued with a co worker over who s wife the best meatloaf turns out it was the same i ve never enjoyed meatloaf but actually crave this wouldn t change a thing except my family loves ginger so we add a little more,255

71732,343847,5,i was so excited to try this that i forgot to add the nuts next time for sure i did this 1 1 2 times so i could use the whole big can of pumpkin i also used mostly applesauce and just a little oil instead of the individual spices i substituted cinnamon plus from pampered chef i will for sure be making this again you jmelyn,324
271489,1910238,5,i love the i m from maine and it s just like the ham boiled dinner my mother used to glad that i found this particular grammie bea i just love it,145
77732,182980,5,this is essentially the same as what i call oklahoma caviar the only difference is i use 1 can of shoe peg corn instead of hominy it makes a side salad for covered dish dinners too,180
82554,713824,5,way over the top i one change more decadance i mix the kahula with 1 smaller size container defrosted cool whip rather than dusting with powdered sugar,151
67854,431284,2,the real thing is by far not as sweet as what comes out of this it is much more tangy rahter than sweet also the calories in the real thing are much lower then this would be if as listed after making the batch as written i cut out the brown sugar and used half the amount of corn syrup added one teaspoon of honey and it was much better i also added some red pepper flakes just a person preference,397
215670,34146,5,this tonight along with 1 2 a roasted turkey breast sweet potatoes and a tossed green salad the cauliflower was excellent i sprayed a foil lined cookie sheet with butter flavored pam then sprayed the florets with the same butter flavored spray lightly sprinkled with salt pepper and a bit of ground garlic or garlic powder not garlic salt roasted for 10 min at 400f then turned them over and roasted another 10 min they were absolutely perfect lightly browned and very depending on what protein i am serving them with i will probably change the spices seasonings to suit the entree will definitely this often soooo much better than boring steamed cauliflower and way less calories than cheese sauce au gratin for sharing your,725
109715,580110,5,this is it it taste exactly like nutella so much cheaper to too you,67
131173,146573,5,this is very similar to a cobbler i use all of the time i used super ripe nectarines and it was the batter is cakey and gooey at the same time and it is perfectly sweet i had a bit of vanilla ice cream with it fantastic,219

83077,67403,5,this is a really moist and flavorful cake for sharing the we were missing dessert here trying to eat healthier i didn t have a cast iron skillet but did use an 8 square metal pan with no problem,194
117892,1386778,5,my husband is dominican so rice is something i cook every day i thought i would try this to give a variation from white rice it was excellent however for those of you who would rather not rinse your rice and still have it come out fluffy and not sticky i can tell you exactly how to do it it is the same way dominican rice is cook follow steps 2 3 5 6 and 7 you do not need to put it in th oven everything is cooked on the stovetop allow all the water to boil out of the pot when you see air holes in the rice and a wooden spoon can stand on its own in the rice then you reduce the heat to medium low and cover the dutch oven with a tight fitting continue cooking the rice for 25 30 minutes do not remove the lid during this time this method is for cooking any type of rice dish and you only have when rice is cooked properly the grains will actually split open down the middle and have a firm texture to them and that is exactly what happens when you cook rice by this method,976
26205,755277,5,crust i ve used it for blackberry pie chicken pot pie and banana cream pie for sharing,86
215513,320549,4,we really enjoyed this even my daughter who hates meatloaf liked this i used only olive oil and added red yellow and green peppers i added a little worcestershire sauce this will replace my old standard meatloaf for sharing this,228

148688,333959,5,fantastic i love these cookies and will them again only problem is i ate too many,81
74483,2002500683,3,as others have mentioned the butter separates as soon as it hits the cool liquids which is to be expected i would recommend oil or parkay if you want the butter flavor i would recommend separating the marinade and use less lemon in the portion you put the chicken in then use more lemon in the portion you use to baste the chicken as it cooks,342
3892,310116,5,very mainly as instructed and really enjoyed,44
200296,1229650,5,i this last night no changes except using a cooling rack rather than a baking sheet and it turned out was very to didn t marinate but it was still deserves the 5 stars i ll definitely continue to this,200

277118,2000850858,3,cookies but they need a little more butter,42
27361,481463,5,just these for turkey day and they are wonderful definitely a to keep,69
28416,50601,4,this was fast and i put more than a pinch of salt in the butter and i don t think it was still enough i like them really salty for the my son and husband carved pumpkins and we wanted to try roasting the seeds this year i m glad we did it will be a tradition from now on again,276

210258,1803116340,3,this smoothie sounds really but it sure is not a diabetic as stated with over 35 grams of carbs and over 24 grams of sugar no way can it be diabetic,148
335364,2000428987,5,and i used seasoned bread crumbs in place of the saltine crackers and added chopped mushrooms the white cream sauce is to adds flavor to the dish and makes it look fancy this will be one of my go to recipes from now on,218
172975,242226,5,these were cookies my husband loved them they 72 decent sized cookies i rolled them into a ball and then in sugar and flattened them with a fork worked,151

111675,224740,3,i loved the spinach in the meatballs fantastic idea and i shall them again however i felt that the stew was a big mish mash of different flavours that didn t go together that well,179

76947,103628,5,i altered this so much that it really wasn t the same salad mainly to use stuff i had on hand left out the almonds snow peas water chestnuts and red pepper used purple onion instead of green onion spiral pasta instead of bowtie and threw in some peas i also added pineapple tidbits and a couple tablespoons of the juice i also used a lot more mayo than the called for i used leftover shredded chicken breast probably about 2 or 3 breasts anyway it all tasted for such an adaptable,480
160639,254805,5,these were lovely moist pancakes i love the added protein from the ricotta and i can t wait to try these with fresh blueberries and bananas for posting,151
140170,329429,5,we ve this two or three times and it s been a big hit what i did was i froze actual orange juice in ziploc freezer bags because we don t have the canned juice concentrate also instead of 12 ice cubes i used four ice cubes and two big scoops of vanilla ice cream very cold and creamy very much like a dreamsicle,310
11793,339674,5,this cake was so when i had a craving for chocolate i just used ingrediants that were lying around the house already wonderful cake defidentally not dry texture,160

29253,697167,5,tish i ve this about 6 times now i recommend dividing the dough into 8 10 equal portions and using them as hamburger buns perfect size and a wonderful texture cocking time decreased to about 20 minutes with a gas convection oven also got results replacing 1 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour and adding an egg very hearty,327
36394,107549,5,you so much for a pie my family loved it no more wondering what to do with all those pears we get from our tree,111
372406,2446499,5,this works a friend of mine told me about your post so i tried it this is going to save me a lot of trips to the market for fresh cilantro,138
148392,609954,5,this is so i ve been looking for a like this for a while a friend of mine this for a party and it was gone before i was able to have seconds,140
32204,774409,5,these 2 times already and about to them a third time because they only last for a day or two everybody loves them both times i ve added chocolate chips because thats what i have on hand i ll have to try some other variations but being a chocoholic these are wonderful brownies that totally hit the spot every time karen,319
78603,377499,5,this doesn t take very much effort i m not sure how to store olive oil in the fridge because it will solidify seems ok in a cool dark cabinet this is really to have on hand,172
116185,2002111871,5,this was my first time making homemade cornbread and it turned out,66
130488,149004,5,tastes like ding dongs only better real with vanilla frosting this has become a favorite cake at my house,105
93592,1019163,5,my first time trying this i it up about a day or so in advance in order to let the flavors meld together like a stew i went to heat it up the next evening and it was all gone my husband had eaten the entire thing in about a 30 hour time span without my knowledge i it again two weeks later also in advance i got called out of town and again didn t get to have more than a tasting my husband was in hog heaven,408
113303,2282432,5,truly worthy of a 5 star rating and i ve only tasted the dough i could eat it by the spoonfuls first off i want to say that i used adams peanut butter and it smelled so fresh and when i opened the jar if you are making peanut butter cookies it s very important to have fresh peanut butter if it s even a little rancid beware that it will taint the whole batch 2nd i used a pecan maple syrup in place of the brown sugar no regrets there i also added chocolate chips though it tasted perfect without the batter is very soupy and hopefully it sets up in fridge if not i plan to bar cookies instead you for a very wonderfully peanut butter cookie,642
82939,2002814134,1,this is not what i envisioned it to be for some reason the dough was not too dry googled how to fix adding more liquid and some butter helped but i would not recommend this not bragging but i am a decent baker but this one did me in and it was a whole days work,261
25885,205730,5,this bread is very moist and but do your best to wait til its a day old to eat it i was unsure how much i liked this the first day because it didn t seem sweet or flavorful enough at first but the flavors really developed overnight and now its i used 5 completely black bananas that were falling out of their skin and it yielded a very moist even bread,352
35599,53057,4,i used sweet turkey sausage to it even lower in fat and because my wife can t do spicy it was still excellent and really really,127
405594,1598961,5,this is and very tangy and strong i crave this dressing at least once a week,76
190128,668861,5,awsome i m trying to them for my ds after wrestling tourment tomorrow and it just isn t working out for me very well the dh son in law wont keep their paws off of them so now i m going to have to another batch very goodness lol,227
110548,2001751469,5,i saw this brand of chili in kroger near central texas on sale for 2 cans at 7 dollars so i thought i would have to try it i liked the photo was and looked like a chili i enjoyed at a restaurant 200 miles away after eating the second can i had to find out how to this this is consistent to the flavors i taste with the chili i believe it would take a processor to get the meat cut to that texture,396
81157,2002437921,5,i my own low carb cheesecake but love this crust i add 1 tsp cinnamon,69
211469,489647,5,this is sooo i also used the triple chunk brownie mix and baked it in a 9x13 pan it was very rich but very oh and i didn t use peanuts either,141
123522,1170547,5,i this again for my mothers birthday and once again everyone loved it this is definately a keeper so much for the,113
228771,697860,5,i have prepared this several times and we just love it it is to prepare and the taste is just unbelievable and it just melts in your mouth,138
159228,447742,5,i ve had this same for over 20 years i can t tell you exactly where i got it from but this makes the most moist cake you would ever want you for posting this here,162
104086,1668048,5,my family absolutely loves this soup they are begging me to it once a week and i m happy to oblige we add 2 cans of corn and 2 cans of black beans both undrained which makes for a perfect broth otherwise we follow the exactly,225
311954,309972,2,i tried this and compared it to the one i that has less ingredients and did not like it as much mine uses a white cake mix 1 cup milk 1 tsp baking soda and three eggs along with the bananas and nuts i am not fond of yellow cake mix,231
8935,125349,5,i love this curry i ve it several times now and have been meaning to post a review the combination of flavor is and its hard to mess up the spices,146
16273,294624,5,excellent i followed the to a tee and it turned out perfect i served it with german bread dumplings this is another keeper for sure karen,137
118078,112411,4,i subbed butter buds sprinkles splenda and used the soy milk they were a bit too salty so next time will use a little less of the butter buds sprinkles and will maybe add a bit of peanut butter as the second extract i used almond next time i will only use vanilla they were pretty for my first time will try again,313
237764,457625,5,i am blown away by the sophisticated taste of this considering the fact it takes less than 10 minutes to prep i thought it was fantastic and it will become a kitchen staple,172
233154,191847,5,these are so so the oldest recipes are sometimes the best right i added more water to mine because i like mine more soupy my husband likes them thicker so i add less water when i these for him i also added a little bit of cumin i love the flavor of cumin with black beans i also add small pieces of smoked sausage because my husband likes meat in his beans and it is really i serve these beans with jasmine rice really you for the beans i them several times per month,467
69191,830079,5,i love this it s quick and like stated in the you can the sauce the way you like i like it spicy so i added more chili sauce but i cut back on the garlic powder can t wait to it again at our next potluck for sharing,215
1551,939432,4,this has terrific flavor the worcestershire sauce really adds to the flavor of the dish the green peppers were a little too soft for my liking though next time i will blanch them boil them for 10 seconds then drop them in cold water and then exclude using the 1 tsp of salt,273
267749,517750,5,i tried this for dinner tonight and it was a big hit i followed the exactly i might cut down on some of the worcestire sauce it was a little too salty for me i will be making this again,185
393794,1769795,5,this is a quot go to quot for our family i have prepared this dish several times amp it is always sure to allow for the full cooking time to ensure that the chops are tender,173
328269,1672366,5,i a homemade alfredo sauce the first time i this dish which it very rich the second time to save some time i used jarred sauce both versions were very the fresh basil really adds a flavor this lasagna is a alternative to traditional recipes,240
74068,104877,3,i found this a bit on the too rich side with all the cheese however my dh loved it and i served it to him 2 nights in a row and each time he said this is really i would recommend a bit more spice to it perhaps 2 tbsp chili powder as i only added 1 but it is a matter of taste how spicy we like our,297
35813,277092,5,everyone loved it,17
167348,1410620,5,i have this twice now and loved it my dh likes it as well its so to you can even it a few hours or a day ahead of time mix it up a bit add your own stuff i just really like how and this is without even trying 5 stars,216
171628,764845,5,this is quick to prepare and would likely appeal to most anyone who eats pork the brown sugar and apples lend flavor to the pork while keeping it moist a definate keeper for when you re looking for something to prepare with ingreadients you have on hand,253
893,8938,5,my family is from maryland and always this pie my aunt who passed away was a white potato pie maker but never told us the full ingredients for her pie this one is,162
315538,935059,5,this is a one i used this and added a few table sppons of dried italian seasoning and it went with my pastas,108
10744,463412,5,this is an absolutely i slightly change it by not using pie crusts i just the filling as directed pour it into baking dish and top it with a rolled out batch of home buttermilk biscuits there s something about the buttermilk biscuits that my family and i all love with this,273
50865,229052,4,i used rasberry rum and it turned out i had to add a little water while cooking and glaze stuck to bottom of pan will line with foil next time,142
96621,363813,5,fairy i decided to add yogurt instead of cream and beef stock instead of chicken stock otherwise i followed everything as it is and it was delish,145
349246,2000628073,5,5 starts when you substitute milk instead of water but overall and very to,74
109385,1053283,4,these are for people on the go for a slight variation i have them with only bacon bits and cheese and they were just as plus it cut out the extra cooking time as lots of people have already mentioned only fill the miffin tin about 2 3 and the eggs puff up just right without going over,285
51140,1383845,5,i varied it up using my own measurements for the jalapenos and chili powder since we prefer chili to be what it s called spicy i also did add a tablespoon of coriander powder which personally to me adds more flavor i didn t have black bean soup or whole so i just left that out i also added a two tablespoons of tomato paste and a can of tomato sauce for consistency i also added beef stock bullion cubes and some water for it to cook this on high for 4 hours in the end i threw in two tablespoons of sour cream and mixed it in since i felt that maybe i went overboard with the chili s but it also adds flavor wonderful that can be personalized for taste it during a winter snow storm when my husband was snowed in and couldn t go to work what a wonderful evening meal,768
77613,835774,5,kudos to angie i used this charmoula with halibut for passover and it was a huge hit,84
74829,204628,4,i liked this very much i used cooked turkey that i had left over and i didn t have any dijon so used a pinch of mustard powder,126
132253,252303,5,i have many banana breads in my day using different recipes i tried this one about 3 yrs ago have been making it ever since it s the best that i have tried my sister now makes it too i give this a 5 star rating,210
31427,851191,5,so so the kids dug into them like there was no tomorrow we will have these again and again as a side to many of our meals,121
399367,548973,5,i love these cookies and have them since the network first introduced them it should be noted that they are not terribly sweet a more common concept in central and south america but the peanut butter and coconut flavors a lovely tea cookie annacia for including this on zaar,274
72069,106854,5,very we kept the saucy a bit chunkier for texture and used light cream cheese and sour cream,92
46501,1201109,5,a little salty but it was my fault used sea salt last teaspoon of the can will try again but i think it 039 s a keeper,118
83464,2669270,5,i know it s annoying when people rate things when they ve modified the however i think the core here is very it gave me direction i did some changes mostly for ease i realize now i probably didn t save much time but i d still it again my way because it was so i used this for the sauce 1 2 jar of classico italian sausage plus 1 jar of barilla tomato and basil i also added a glug of two of red wine mark west pinot sorry i don t measure and a little bit of fennel because i love the flavor and red pepper flakes there were seasonings in the premade sauce so i didn t need to add much so i didn t use onion garlic fresh red pepper or italian seasonings outlined in original in a separate pan i used 1 package of lean ground turkey jennie o 93 7 after i cooked it in a skillet it i added a bunch of fresh not frozen spinach and then 1 package of sliced mushrooms and then added that mixture to the red sauce i salted the eggplant and let it sit for an hour or so salt one side at a time and then pushed a paper towel down on it to get rid of as much water as possible i cooked for 7 minutes each side it s hard to slice thin without some professional gadget but i tried to cut as thin as possible so that it would not be chewy i misread the directions for the cheese mixture and just all the ingredients in together so it was kinda clumpy but it worked fine and saved a few steps i had 2 layers of this mixture just plop on top of each eggplant and then spread it out to cover i also doubled the green onions totally forgot to take a picture it went fast it filled up a 9x11 glass dish i think this will be a regular meal around here my husband ate his as is i added mine to some curly pasta and it was sooooooooo he s the carb watching diabetic,1744
19678,110135,5,excellent i ll never use store bought again,43
80891,315806,4,this was very although i did find the sweetness overwhelming i will probably this again as an occasional treat but will use slightly less sauce,143
5170,2919674,5,i 039 ve tried several recipes including taking a stab at coming up with one myself and i thought the one from my mom 039 s old better homes and gardens cookbook was the best hands down until now i think the butter makes the big difference in the flavor and the baking powder is what adds the leavening that makes the cakes so light and crisp around the edges just the way i like them i had to use evaporated milk this time but it didn 039 t seem to alter the at all i 039 m just glad i a double batch and froze the extras breakfast all next week for sure for posting this and you quot pete quot,595
258508,2001625595,5,this was very i had plain sausage and wish i had added sage to it i would add only 3 t of flour it was too thick for my taste that said i really loved this and will it again and again,183
224680,328289,4,i didn t have any lime leaves or hot peppers but it still turned out very i used half a can of very spicy red curry paste it is fast too,136
39155,29361,4,this was very to i did it as a dip for a tailgate party and everybody loved it i spiced the chicken with salt pepper cilantro and cooked it in olive oil it was very,164
115116,694899,4,i used 200g of udon but still found it a bit salty dish but will reduce the amount of oyster dark soy sauce next time,117
252250,366781,4,this was eaten by all however it is pretty bland but sometimes bland is i only had 4 ounces of cream cheese and that was plenty otherwise i as written i will again just because of the simplicity of the dish,206
94412,2002224319,5,excellent base open to interpretation if desired have both types multiple times with multiple variations as well,112
19383,29813,5,fantastic this was soooo what a neat change for dinner this was very filling comfort,84
164368,690853,5,this is a i used orange jello and served it with orange segments with a little of the extra icing it is not too sweet and holds up no weeping or watering down the leftover cake kept very well excellent to the last crumb i will definitely use this one again and try a different jello fruit combination next time this is a winner,327
1580,8681,4,you i have been looking for this type of we used to rool the dough into 2 rounds and add an almond filling between the layers,125
143527,29268,5,this goes together so fast and is so to the finished dish tastes wonderful i will be adding this to my personal favorites and will be making it often you for sharing,165
11599,511026,5,if i could give this 10 stars i would it was the most popular dish on our thanksgiving table yesterday everyone loved it however i only used 3 4 cu sugar and 3 3 4 cu sweet potato because i had more i m glad i did because i think it might have been just a little too sweet if i had not so if you re looking for a sweet but not too sweet casserole use a little less sugar the topping was loved it,395
357657,337120,4,different but as a traditional rum and coke fan i might use less kahlua next time prepared for zwt5 team jammin java jivers,123
427411,2000169146,4,this is a fantastic only if you use much more rhubarb than the calls for even if you were to finely mince the rhubarb with only 2 cups in a 9x13 pan you would hardly taste it between the crust and the cheesecake layer i actually ended up using 8 9 cups i have an abundance in my yard so this is for me to do but even if you have to buy it i would use at least 5 cups as the other commenter suggested,399
42316,214565,5,this was we marinaded the steak for 24 hours i a gravy with the marinade it was one of the best steaks we ve ever had the whole family loved it,143
83475,153919,5,this is an absolutely i used chili pepper flakes instead of serrano peppers and cilantro instead of basil,105

136990,857805,3,the flavor of this dish was pretty i agree that draining the tomatoes is a idea mine turned out a little watery as some people had mentioned over all pretty i d also probably increase the veggies or parhaps even use spaghetti squash,232
179903,419585,5,this was absolutely i followed the exactly as written here i did prepare my eggplant first by salting it to draw out the bitterness which also gives the eggplant more of a chewiness and less of that raw taste i used shaved parmesan which worked just as well as the grated parma would i give this a 5 stars it was crispy and savory and went well with the celery root mashed potatoes i it can also be vegan using vegan mayo,421
89992,1027074,5,omg was this i was eating it out of the pan i did some changes i used one large chicken breast skinless boneless and cut into large chunks and sauteed lightly and added a half pound of turkey smoked sausage eckrich i used cream of celery soup added two heaping tablespoons of sour cream and enough milk to it pourable i also added about a half teaspoon each of rosemary thyme and celery seed i rubbed the spices before putting them into the soup mixture to get them to be more fragrant left the onions into rings and left skin on potatoes also used garlic salt instead of reg salt,580

2886,2927802,5,best ever and so,16
243350,289412,5,this was soooooo i used low sodium broth but since i am a salt lover ended up adding sea salt later on before eating the flavor was and we couldn t even taste the lemon i did not have savory on hand but it still ended up delish for using your creative genuises for this one for rsc 10,284
27221,309422,5,this is a wonderful pasta salad i a few changes to the though instead of green pepper i used red personal preference grape tomatoes cut in half reduced fat feta cheese instead of provolone turkey pepperoni instead of regular pepperoni because there s much less fat and calories added 1 diced cucumber and a small jar of chopped marinated artichoke hearts for the dressing i used about 1 2 the sugar it called for and added more oregano and some basil this is a wonderful light summer meal so much for posting,508
32147,2002208350,5,the whole family loves this i use the short ribs with the bone in change the sauces for whatever i have in the cupboard with a chipotle bbq sauce adjust the depending on how many ribs you ve got,194
74790,163083,4,this was very i found that the filling was a perfect amount for a store bought crust if making a deep dish pie with your own crust it may not fill to the top mine was done in 1 hour and 15 min i found it a little on the sweet side so next time i d cut the sugar to 1 cup very and i will this again it s the easiest pie i ever and would be excellent with a scoop of vanilla ice cream,382
78305,359891,5,i didn 039 t have a dense bread so i used regular sandwich bread the bread took up a bit too much of the batter to cook all of the way through so i fried one side of the bread after dipping in the batter and then put the nutella on it before putting the two halves together to fry it seemed to turn out well and was very my kids loved it,337
302120,2001330613,5,this took longer to put together than i thought it would however it was worth the extra time i ll be making this on a regular basis,131
22091,30067,5,this was probably the tastiest meatloaf i ever i didn t have veal or turkey so i had to use just hamburger and ground pork but it still came out wonderful it wasn t dry every bite had wonderful flavor and it looked so when it came out of the oven so much for sharing this it s a new family favorite,298

542,45489,5,this was tasting and i used caesar italian dressing which added a little more flavor i didn t have the right crackers so i mixed crushed ritz crackers with parmesan cheese we loved them,185

100468,30503,4,really 2x more dredge and coating than i needed wish i had more tomatoes to use it up i think next time i will go for slightly thinner slices was served with some homemade apricot hot pepper jelly,196
42281,629580,5,i this last fall and it was absolutely wonderful i used bottled lemon juice but that was the only change it tasted just like autumn i put this in many small bowls and froze them pulling out one at a time throughout the next 6 months they keep in the fridge for 2 3 weeks although very few bowls it that long we ate them too fast this year i m living in a place where autumn is not as noticeable so i just bought a pumpkin to this and help it feel like autumn here,463

25587,1257339,4,i m giving this only 4 out of 5 because i only the marinade for the chicken and did not finish with the sauce the marinade was excellent the cinnamon really added flavor and aroma,179

33665,372185,5,loved it both husband and i thought this as i did use taco seasoning in place of the spices and i used 8 small tortillas instead of 4 large very,144
159787,1037617,5,i this cake and oh my god it was so that my family ate in in two days i had to bake another one a few days later we craved it so bad the other wonderful thing about this cake other than the taste is that it is very to with not a ton of ingredients l o v e d it,260
179719,494184,5,this was my boyfriend and i were absolutely amazed that it tasted so and i thought it tasted just like the sloppy joes my mom used to for me when i was growing up and what makes it better is how it was to there was virtually no prep time and you don t have to pay that close attention to it while its simmering of course i did a few minor adjustments i didn t use the onions or peppers in this because i didn t have them so i used dried onion flakes and pepper flakes the stuff that you put on a pizza also i added various spices such as oregano garlic powder and an organic all purpose seasoning what i think it taste more like mom s though was the sloppy joes seasoning packet i had lying around and used anyways it was and i m glad that we had the leftovers too because they taste just as as the fresh,804
63158,245609,5,this is a scruptious venison i did the sauce ahead of time and just heated it up when the meat was ready so i could concentrate on making sure the venison wouldn t be overcooked the sauce compliments the venison perfectly served with roasted brocolli garlic smashed potatoes crusty bread and a bottle of cabernet scrumptious,324
205890,2000634011,2,i don t know how people are giving this five stars they must have never had a peanut butter cookie these are tasteless try a different and don t waste your time,160
96213,290578,5,what a wonderful pudding it was such a treat and an way to use up stale bread i used currants and didn t really keep track of how much butter i used just enough to butter one side of each slice rather generously and grease the dish other than that i followed the exactly and it was it even looked pretty the only thing i might do next time is add another 1 2 tbsp sugar to boost the taste a little for sharing this outstanding,426
26168,557564,2,these just didn t work out for me perhaps i just have really high bagel standards but i think they were too bready and too yeasty,129
67795,204628,4,didn t know whether to post a review for this as i only used the filling with ready pastry but the filling was i m sure it would be even more so with the pastry from the,169
254169,771965,5,i reduced the sugar by 1 4 and it was still sweet enough i will try reducing the sugar again by one whole cup next time just to see how it comes out i am glad i read the reviews as i would have ended up putting it in the refrigerator instead i let the cookies at room temperature until cold then put them in the fridge and they are a perfect texture last time i a no bake cookie i placed it in the fridge without knowing better and didn t know the reason why they ended up gooey now after reading the reviews here i know the reason for that,540
1157,47636,5,so and so and very addictive i them for a party instead of the usual bowl of nuts and they disappeared fast,107
184637,1985315,5,and i used thyme instead of rosemary and added extra garlic to the potatoes the flavor of the potatoes which had roasted under the fish was superb,146

362648,76014,5,first time trying chard and we loved it it exactly as the said and will try it again the only thing i might try adding to this sometime is some balsamic just to try something a little different but again very the way the is written,231
8692,561488,5,moist and not too sweet instead of sugar i used 1 cup of sugar splenda blend the flour was unbleached i also substituted 1 cup dried apricots apples for the nuts due to allergies next time i it however i will use only 1 2 cup oil and 1 2 cup 2 tbsp sunsweet lighter bake cool whip makes a really topping for this cake,317

419466,175985,4,these are very to and taste i did add more blueberries just because i love them the only thing i didn t like was the dry texture to the finished scone wonder about more liquid or perhaps a little more butter next time overall extremely though,242
91572,1803289985,5,best tasting potato salad ever i used a green pepper instead of the red it was delish,85

336215,1278514,5,this was really lovely i have this the original way before but i am watching my calories so i skipped the beef added spinach to the cheese mix about 2 cups fresh chopped and 1 5 cups sliced zucchini on the first layer of cheese i also used no boil noodles so it was all done after 55 minutes just needed to cool big hit with the friends i just had over holds together nicely and the sauce on the bottom makes clean up super,423
179384,2221422,5,i have been looking for a bisque as i use this as the sauce for lobster ravioli yum i used 3t tomato sauce and an extra tbsp of butter to help thicken i also put it in the blender for a smooth sauce layer the bisque and the ravioli with a light dusting of parm cheese put in the oven for 10 mins and serve with garlic knots bread for posting this,346
33170,501717,5,grilled jerk chicken i cut breasts into strips marinated and then grilled on short skewers for party finger that everyone enjoyed princess buttercup,148
204187,279204,5,i this today to go with a beef roast and it was so my roast hardly had any drippings and i didn t have any beef stock on hand so i followed the with the following substitions i used chicken stock and beef bouillon powder and then i added a dash of kitchen bouquet for color and it was superb,291
22306,434636,5,this is fabulous this is exactly what i was looking for when researching vietnamese curry chicken i want to it again tonight the flavor is so i just couldn t wait to take the next bite for posting this janroundoz i give this 5 stars,232
54397,189932,3,this was really served it over couscous with some mixed veges only problem i had was that my meat chunks were far too large i didn t bother with the garlic powder as i just used garlic paste and i used fresh thyme but rosemary paste,232
46501,1314084,2,hm i this bread twice and it just came out heavy i have only found one bread on recipezaar that has worked for me maybe our measurements or flour or yeast for that matter are different in new zealand,199
144837,60101,5,i this last week subbing tofu for the chicken and veggie ingredients for the soup and broth absolutely delish it was a little too much to fit into my 4 qt crock pot so i threw it in my dutch oven and cooked it on the stovetop i was super lazy and just threw the noodles into the soup to cook i served it with homemade whole wheat and ate far too much of both,358
51784,350471,5,i really enjoyed this soothing sweet alcoholic beverage its very in the winter all the spices really the house smell fantastic and it tastes as as it smells it s very much a sipping beverage due to the high level of sweetness you so much for sharing,249
23404,294119,5,i thought this was phenomenal however i added a few extra things that i think add an punch to this soup i used 1 can refried beans instead of mashed black beans as per another reviewer and to that i added key lime juice fresh cilantro chili powder and cayenne we like the spice creamed corn and green chiles to the onion and broth i added minced garlic i served it with sour cream shredded monterey jack cheese fresh cilantro and crispy tortilla strips that i whipped up it was i think the key lime juice adds a ton of flavor for the basis of a,544
69046,608500,5,as a kansas citian i have a appreciation for smokestack and they re cheesy corn bake is no exception i the as printed with a few minor changes i increase the garlic to 1 4 tsp add 1 4 tsp of ground black pepper and about 1 tbsp of heavy cream when folding in the corn and ham delicous,284
271097,1350389,5,one word excellent i added a pinch of cayenne red pepper to the flour mix and sliced garlic after adding the liquid so and,122
304166,2001115496,4,excellent tzatziki sauce modification suggestions i would suggest that you halve your cucumber lengthwise scoop out and discard the seeds before chopping i wring out the chopped salted cucumber in a square of cheesecloth to get all the excess liquid out the more liquid you get out of the cucumber the creamier the sauce i replaced 1 3 of the greek yogurt with a new product on the market greek cream cheese amp yogurt blend i placed the greek cream cheese in the processor with the cucumber garlic dill lemon juice amp pepper scrape down the sides frequently and pulse until smooth the addition of the greek cream cheese really makes the tzatziki creamy amp thick,664
212491,428644,5,this was a very and tastey easily achievable with stuff i usually have in the house i had dinner cooking within about 5 minutes my problem was that i used a very tough cut of meat won t do that again so it didn t come out as well as it could have i added some chili powder to the steaks and salt chili powder and lime juice to the avacado mixure,345
69429,2002594158,4,a but unfortunate choice of pans i d recommend using a regular baking pan vs the bundt pan this cake is just too moist to keep its shape even after letting it cool slightly on a rack running a knife along the edges and carefully turning it over the top came off our cake very unfortunate when it s a holiday cake for presentation i m not sure why sites are so keen to favor looks and looks that you ll get 5 of the time maybe if you re lucky over function,455
415342,1264331,3,this was satisfying but needs some tweaking the ingredient amounts didn t correspond well with what s available in stores needing 16oz of tomatoes when they typically come in 14 5oz cans and the measuring standards were a bit confusing varying from pounds to ounces to cups i felt like a crust of some kind was needed so i a quick pot pie crust and spread it across the pan bottom it provided some balance the onions were a problem they definitely should be diced not chopped they were too coarse for such a dish and i had too much the flavor would probably manifest greater if the ingredients were left to sit a few hours before baking the garlic would be allowed to meld in and perhaps the hominy could better absorb the spices a concept overall but definitely use your culinary reasoning and modify as needed it goes well with sour cream and tortilla chips,859
222963,236750,5,my whole family loved this i it as part of a mediterranean meal i served souvlaki hummus and pita bread and tzatsiki i will definitely be making this again,155
43272,592373,5,soooo one of my daughters these they re irresistibly i m trying not to eat the whole batch,90
91192,97950,4,my son s class this for snack one day the kids were broke up into groups and they their own ice cream this would be a thing to do with the kids this summer,155
4178,645246,5,my husband and i can t get enough of this cornbread i ve it with almost every kind of dish and it always goes well with it the moisture level is you don t have to have it with soup or chili to sop up the liquid in fact it s even all by itself as a snack it reheats well but it s pretty cold too the cream style corn adds enough sweetness for us but i can see that some people might like to add a bit of sugar too,412
22159,961542,5,dimple to whip up and everyone loved it at the cookout we had last weekend i added in some green grapes too went with the apples,128
11107,23463,5,my wife was like why are you looking for a for buttered noodles i said i was looking for something different she rolled her eyes i this reipe and she asked me to it 3 times already i only used a half cup of butter and that was perfect,234
294620,813471,5,excellent i was a little worried i didn t have time to let the flavors blend in the fridge i it about half an hour before dinner i let it set at room temp mixing every few min it was lvs2cook,191
98307,83400,5,fay my only complaint is it only makes 3 serves none left over for a midnight snack so to prepare and eat i found it was cooked after 25 minutes i used vanilla extract next time i will try the rose water i used fresh coconut and yes it tasted like a cross between a macaroon and custard for posting,298
204682,292308,4,these were in a kraft foods quarterly magazine i really enjoy how they are to personally i like the stuffing addition flavor my favorite is the fiesta version,158
110415,206751,4,this was very moist and it seems like a lot of streusel topping but it comes out fine,85
447028,549669,1,these are the worst pancakes the nutmeg is horrible and the oats were not ground fine enough by my processor,108
143615,1686323,5,i have been making diferent recipes for a caramel that is soo that i cant stop eating it and have several this week this is the last one i will try and will use it for all my recipes that use caramel it is,205
369222,1730384,5,i tried this yesterday i love that it was just enough for the 2 of us although if i ever get a bundt pan i 039 m gonna want a full cause this cake was just what i was looking for and my cowboy is already asking when i 039 ll be making it again,243
49230,1449216,5,this has quickly become a favorite i ve it with home chicken stock which adds a flavor i wouldn t worry about adding too much beer or stock if you want to cover the meat you can boil or simmer the gravy down afterwards,218
45809,681465,3,i m sorry about only giving this three stars but first i would never this with chicken breasts again i would use dark meat like thighs the chicken came out dry and i think it would have been more flavorful with dark meat also 3 4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes was too much inho especially when this is stated to be a copycat of bourbon chicken they sell most every mall i ve ever been in children are served this all the times in malls and it s not this spicy i like spice don t get me wrong however thinking this was similar to the versions we had in chinese carry outs i this for the whole family and then my child couldn t eat any of it next time i would drastically cut that down to maybe 1 8 tsp i thought the sauce was very but overall i would have to more of it to have some over the rice too so next i would probably double the sauce portion of the,856
371566,2002577573,5,i doubled the swapped out the regular onion for 1 red onion and subbed the other onion for chives instead i also used half mild mustard and half seeded and used full fat mayonnaise highly recommend it went down a treat,218
124016,407781,5,i loved this i never would have thought to add grapes but it was soo i a lot of smoothies for healthier choices i used fresh ground flax seeds and added whey protien vanilla ice cream flavor as i am on a diet that requires me to take whey protein still though,259
244387,667505,5,i this soup to serve 30 40 people for our italian daughter in law s wedding shower i didn t change anything and everyone was wowed i love it and see no reason to try any other now for posting,191
366319,1340977,5,we had this for dinner tonight and it was really froze well too one of my problems with freezing is that i m always afraid that it s going to taste like it has been frozen and this doesn t at all i this pretty much as directed except i used a mexican blend cheese and left the green onions off but only because i don t like onions oh yeah didn t use the tortilla chips either because i forgot to get them at the store very very though will again,445
103983,310946,4,i this for a quick dinner one nite it came together quickly and easiy i served it with a green salad to get some veggies in i found it a bit dry and may add a bit of milk next time the kids loved it,198
110669,294153,5,this was so and didn t last long i followed the directions exactly and it turned out this is a keeper,101
93308,1303175,3,i froze and reheated this my potatoes were a little smushy but the carrots were not done if i this again i would add some spices maybe cumin i used half a bottle of worcestershir sauce i was really glad i used that tip from another reviewer,240
112371,2897767,5,i used 1 5 lbs of shrimp and served this dish over whole wheat orzo 1 precooked cup it should also work well over spaghetti or linguine the lemon zest really brightens this dish it is to find a quick that is so,210
35813,2000677347,5,excellent as is or as base for oatmeal cookie spinoffs a bit too much sugar for me so i cut back to only 3 4 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown could have cut out another 1 4 cup white or brown sugar without harming the i think i was short the 3 cups of rolled oats so i used 2 cups oats and 1 cup ground dried unsweetened coconut besides those changes subs i added about 1 2 cup of chopped nuts mostly pecans the baking time was 11 11 5 minutes for me in a turbo oven set to 175 c since my oven bakes unevenly from front to back i turned the tray after 8 minutes the two minutes time extra on the warm baking tray was perfect hile the next batch cooked it 56 sized cookies hard to resist and very hard to eat only 1,713
31901,222970,5,this is the peach cobbler i ve been searching for very much a five star the few leftovers were quickly eaten for breakfast because of other reviews i cut down sugar in batter and sugar in filling to 1 2 cup each and it was plenty sweet,235
34382,1565956,4,very to i ignored the simmer part just put them on medium high heat simmering seemed like it would take forever i will use this again for sure,142
2509,629580,5,i just these for my daughter s preschool class i m sure they re going to love them so this 72 mini muffins so plenty for us at home too the was so to mix up i didn t have any mini chips so i just chopped up some regular size chips in the processor worked i ll definitely be making these again,292
73440,322520,5,i really love this bread especially toasted i did some moderations though instead of 3 cups of regular plain flour i used 2 cups of whole wheat pastry flour and then 1 cup of regular white i downed the sugar to 3 tablespoons which is still a considerable amount for bread but since it was part whole wheat i had to add a bit more than 2 tbsp so the wheat flavor doesnt take over after i poured the beer in the dough smelled strongly of a yeast solution i then decided to add 1 tsp of butter flavoring in it since i wasn t sure how the bread wouldve tasted had i left it without the flavoring the bread took about 50 minutes to bake one thing i would definitely change about this is the amount of melted butter i put in i listened to another reviewer and poured only 1 4 cup of melted butter on top before putting it in the oven but i think i could even decrease than to 2 3 tbsp of butter because all the excess butter flowed to the corners of the loaf while it was in the oven some of this butter seeped down all the way to the bottom which was how i got 1 4 of the bottom of the loaf to be burnt,1097
3760,40109,4,i like to add about 4 to 6 ounces of heavy whipping cream i will thicken it up a bit as well as it much more smoooooth,118
5083,268272,5,because i was pressed for time i used cut up boneless skinless chicken thighs after boiling the meat long enough to create a broth i removed 1 2 cup and set aside i added carrots peas onions and garlic while the veggies cooked i the dumplings and substituted the broth for the milk they turned out wonderful it was a sunday dinner for sharing,342
172168,293207,4,have this with pomegranite looks wonderful and tastes pretty too,64
89751,588247,5,very and they tasted fantastic i stuck a hersheys kiss in the middle just to add a little extra sweetness and didn t bother with icing just one question the batter was a little too thick so i added a little 3 tbsp of milk and later a few of the cup cakes overspilled out,270
173349,91340,5,this is cooling as i type i snagged a piece from it because it smelled so and i couldn t resist i also it in a loaf pan and i have put a lime glaze on top after poking holes in it so it could soak in i didn t use the peanuts just out of personal preference you have to try this one if you like limes,299
275998,745523,5,we liked this a lot i skipped the cinnamon based on one of the reviews that it resembled pumpkin pie flavorings i also skipped the allsice i found this to be very such an all purpose you could change the seasoning to it like sausage pepperoni chicken etc never pay for high priced seitan again,293
319422,1086079,5,because i wasn t feeling well i didn t want to cook an elaborate meal my husband and i were very surprised at how this was is sometimes better i served it over pasta to get all those juices,189
69360,143656,5,this muffin was exactly what i was craving the flavours blended together wonderfuly i followed this to a t only i added 1 1 2 tbs of cinnamon and some extra cranberries for the will definitley use again maybe next time i will try some blueberries or orange craisins mmmmm again,277
406887,636217,5,this was a hit here and we are not tuna lovers the white wine vinegar and olive oil all the difference,102
52985,121193,4,this was fast tasted you,24
151681,158871,2,this needed more seasoning i used half the oil butter and flour and it still came out rich and i also used frozen corn as there was no canned corn on hand and ham as we had to use it up my ailing hubby had three fortifying bowls tip about making roux in the microwave,267
69650,233616,5,i have fond memories of speckkartoffel from when we lived in germany so it was a pleasure to find this i downsized the amounts there s just 2 of us and cooked it in my cast iron skillet on the side burner of my gas grill while i grilled some steaks perfect you,260
47464,571308,4,i these this year for christmas cookie trays and will them again i crushed the oreos in the processor and that worked out well although i had to crush a few more to cover all the balls i didn t dip them in chocolate although i believe that would have taken them to even a higher level they mellowed in the refrigerator overnight and the kahlua flavor came through more i think,376
220460,2001382387,1,it was ok but i didnt like at all,33
51550,245798,3,hmmmm sugar in real southern cornbread and no bacon grease we call that northern cornbread,90
367439,980739,5,this was i used green pepper instead of red and i added a whole onion to the pot for 4 servings i added two extra cloves of garlic as well other than that i followed the directions step by step and wow wonderful next time i might add some roughly chopped peanuts but you certainly don t need them i found the quite satisfying texture wise without them perfect for vegans so much,378
67449,230099,5,this is and when i grind the onions i also grind a tomato with it i add curry leaves to the fish also whole green chilli for flavor the curry fresh curry leaves have an flavor,175
43068,835936,4,we enjoyed this for a quick and meal rather than a large 9x13 i two 8x8 pans lined with foil one for dinner and one for the freezer froze prior to baking also doubled the chili and it was just enough next time i might add some hot peppers a can of chilies or possibly a can of rotel i doubled the onion as well because we love onions here the buns on the bottom got a little hard for my taste so next time i ll bake about 20 mins instead of 30 we did eat fritos with dinner which was so i can see adding a layer to the casserole coleslaw on hotdogs is standard where we live and next time i plan to have some on hand as a topping if i were serving this to a crowd i d set traditional hotdog toppings out so people could adjust it to taste it tastes as is just like a hotdog with chili cheese onion and mustard but for folks who like their dogs with everything i think it may be a bit lacking update so baked the frozen one yesterday at 350 it needed about 45 minutes straight from the freezer to heat up when making hotdogs i typically steam the buns so i preferred the frozen casserole as the bun was very soft just shy of mushy if you prefer a toasted bun i do not recommend freezing,1185
23414,313014,3,but may leave out the chili powder next time personal preference very to,72
240188,703661,4,this was very very rich the first time i it i used shells the second time i it slightly different and eliminated the flour butter and milk and used the whipping cream and 2 eggs and the cheese and it was perfect,211
26370,652683,5,at first i wasn t sure about this cake because it isn t the overly sweet variety we are used to but then i had it the next day after a night in the fridge and i found myself giggling with pleasure as i ate a piece for breakfast this is luxury in cake form and i am a believer all other chocolate cake recipes are being thrown out this really is the only one i ll use going forward you for sharing,396
163124,185466,4,this is a i m not a huge burger fan but this one was just fantastic i used low fat mozzarella instead of the monterey jack and added a little more garlic the patties didn t stick together to well but i think that was my fault in the process,240
54559,2002243683,5,this is our favorite bubble so far we have tried others and had not as results it creates strong bubbles that last a while before popping they won t collapse before you can appreciate the swirling colors the trick is letting it quot marinate quot you have to be patient and let the mix sit for a couple days even a week is it makes the ingredients bond better and you will have better results if you mix it and plan to use it right away you could be disappointed most likely because it pops right away like cheap store bought bubbles you for this you guys are,559
170114,1801901544,5,this is excellent soup i a few small changes to the i added 2 tbsp tomato paste and 1 tsp of harissa paste this added a depth of flavour and a little heat when the soup was done i processed half in my blender then added it back into the pot it thickened the soup and melded the flavours my son the vegetarian and my husbandm the carnivore both loved the soup and it will definitely a regular appearance on our table next time i will double or triple the and put several containers in my freezer,494
236998,2000938822,4,i have zucchini relish for years i take a cheese cloth and squeeze out all the extra water i also add jalapeno s which we run through the processor it gives it a little extra kick,179
25905,346191,5,we loved this dish and will it again you nurse di,49
98142,687589,5,fantastic kiwi with success on first attempt,44
152347,826406,5,first time i have ever a cake filling this is wonderful i it twice once with all raspberries and the other with a combination of raspberries and blueberries i added 1 tsp of cornstarch extra to just the raspberries and 1 1 2 tsp to the raspberries blueberries combo perfect,273
30515,1434508,3,to soup needs more flavor i doubled the cheese added salt and pepper garnished with bacon and sour cream but it still needs more,128
474954,2090162,5,well this is more than a 5 star this complies for taste combination style and it is rally attractive for this winner,116
108616,842017,5,what a terrific batter we just had broccoli cauliflower zucchini mushrooms and onion rings and everthing turned out perfectly i held back on the salt per colcadsmom s suggestion only using about half of what the called for and used beer excellent i love the consistency and by the way i doubled the and had no problems with it at all karen,339
130653,148447,4,i this with my german boyfriend and he insisted that we cooked it the way german people might cook it first of all we didn t cut up the sausage into small pieces after frying the onion garlic we added kraut stired and set the kraut to one side sausages the other side then we let it stand on the stove for a while stir a bit to prevent burning after 15 minutes or so it s done my boyfriend totally loved it i guess we ll be making it more in the future for sharing the,468

497295,306726,5,such an unusually fun and creative,34
26110,2132030,5,these are the best homemade biscuits i ve eaten and that it tough to say considering my father me a lot of biscuits growing up they were a breakfast and sometimes dinner staple along with potatoes and eggs but yeah this makes a perfect buttermilk biscuit they are moist fluffy not too baking soda nor baking powder tasting they have a ton of flavor due to the buttermilk to the point where i just don t see myself making biscuits without buttermilk anymore the only changes i were that i actually added a heaping tablespoon of malt powder i like that subtle flavor in my biscuits and i would say that next time i would set my oven to 430 instead of 450 because the tops browned pretty deeply before the middle of the biscuits cooked no big deal though this is definitely going to be my new permanent biscuit you for sharing it,826
72887,457146,5,oh muh goodness the brownies i with this didn t want to bother with the cupcake papers lol turned out so well i started baking at 400 degrees for 8 minutes but i was afraid the edges would burn before the guts were done so i lowered the temp to 375 and baked for another 7 minutes until nothing stuck to the ole toothpick i know they won t last long in my home you for sharing,376
102833,1949845,5,i this christmas day to go along with my honey baked ham turned out and was particularly since i didn 039 t have to slave in the kitchen while everyone else was mingling i had a 3 75 lb boneless turkey breast so i probably cooked it only 6 hrs and only needed half of one can of broth since there was plenty of liquid in the crockpot i also browned the flour before making the gravy amp sprinkled in a little bit of sage kept it on warm in the crockpot till we were ready to eat doesn 039 t get any easier than that,515
47344,63498,5,christmas candy sahara for your recipes,39

1209,2000334207,5,absolutely love this perfect as is however i added a couple pinches of cayenne and topped it with some shredded cheddar before i put it in the oven and loved it even better 5 stars for sure everyone keeps asking me to bring it for parties and get togethers,256
37044,1390983,5,i posted the pictures with the yellow striped plates this was super this was the first time i ve brittle before and it turned out we used pistachios instead of peanuts and we put it all on one cookie sheet instead of two still makes a lot for the,246
249933,1972067,2,due to my spanish heritage i was compelled to try this the ingredients list and the instructions do not match first of all i tried using the tomato sauce into the mix but it came out too granny and overall yucky the mixture remind me of traditional quot chimichurry quot which i think it might be too strong flavor wise with this kind of fish overall experience will not try again,380
85782,277472,5,this was fantastic healthy and inexpensive i this exactly as written and would not change a thing,97
74214,1169750,5,loved it as directed will be on the frequent flyer list,55

299268,243474,5,this was and used hot sausage baked on a buttered cookie sheet which it really to pinch the edges together cut it in 24 equal portions and about 4 portions was a serving per person,180
12584,98467,5,we are greedy pigs when it comes to corn on the cob and i cannot believe i have never tried this seeing how i like things to be in the kitchen it was also much neater no little bits of silk sticking to everything and the shuck and silk came off as easily as peeling a banana,274
215370,2002233261,5,i used this soup and menu at least 6 or 7 years ago i lost 62 with it using it intermittently with healthy eating on my days off i have kept all that weight off if i start to gain i immediately cut back on my i am going to it again tomorrow and try to lose another 60 we shall see the soup does taste very i use less chili just a lot of work making it,351
235269,1778790,4,with some tweaks i halved the but kept the amount of garlic lemon the same and used dried parsley since it s all i had on hand i used chicken broth as well it turned out perfect with the doubled garlic and lemon,211
29074,2273530,4,creamy but need to up the ginger and lemon next time served with soy coconut chicken cucumber salad and stir fry bok choy a keeper,130
339905,2001975070,5,i can t believe this this is the first bread machine that i have really and truly enjoyed i have always gotten tough chewy heavy and just plain boring bread from my bread machine it s a very and expensive machine too i lost the manual to my machine so i got online to find a to today for sunday dinner i did not expect this to turn out so well this is by far the best bread i have ever had out of a bread machine i was a little dubious to say the least because the is so the bread was tender light and browned perfectly the entire loaf was consistent and just top notch in fact we snarfed down the entire 3lb loaf and i was forced to another loaf i can t say enough about this i had to add just about three tablespoons more warm water other than the water the was just bomb,773
97573,134259,5,i cannot believe it that i havent reviewed this embarrassed even though i have photographed it all i can say is ive it on every possible occasion and it turns excellent and i did omit step 15 and 16 as i thought the gravy was quite thick by itself,247
62153,536359,4,very i was looking on here to find an quick with the stuff i had on hand and this one fit the bill very we sqeezed the lemon on the chicken when it was almost done it mad a little extra sauce to put on top,205
129926,1039189,4,i wish it would have told me to shred the chicken finely the family said the diced chicken was hard to chew i also chopped a bell pepper and sprinkled it on top for color and flavor,181
232015,322850,5,i switched this up a little i used white chocolate chips and rather than using creamer i added a few tablespoons of caramel flavoring syrup absolutely and i m sure the original would be just as enjoyable,203
38298,282745,5,absolutely delish i always get this soup when we go to og i used kale in this and had it with california cobb club sandwiches california cobb club sandwiches for the,165
224493,311260,5,my grandson loved this everyone else did too you for a ggrat,60
20184,1234170,4,i have many recipes saved in my zaar cookbook but this is my first review i just had to review this absolutely and as a mid morning snack next time i will follow other suggestions and omit the white sugar and reduce the brown sugar to maybe 1 2 cup may also omit the chocolate chips and just drizzle melted chocolate on top once the bars are cooled and still in the pan,369
151301,611630,2,the bread is too salty for my family amp i palate it rised nicely looked scrumptious amp smelled wonderful i give it 2 stars for that,133
285013,299996,5,this was a big hit at a recent get together very to like another reviewer i also added sliced onion under the roast i d definitely this again,141
48056,65563,5,this is a must for the holidays i will be making it every christmas it s really with chopped walnuts people couldn t believe it only took me 3 minutes to they all wanted the the only problem with it is that i can t stop eating it,229
16659,1749981,5,very my 9 yr old and husband loved it will def again,52
400335,2002134367,5,one thing we indians and pakistanis agree on is bhindi being my favorite cant ask for a better trying it today have not tasted it but i think it will come out decently love you guys keep posting more stuff like this,215
10219,257730,5,try a jar one with a large mouth and then you can screw on the top and shake it up or well a bottle i suppose would also sense we had this all through boarding school lived off it really i would suggest try before you knock it imported nescafe some ethnic aisles in the supermarket have it from mexico middle eastern corner stores often do as well think of it this way there must be enough demand that they bother to import it in,429
138528,490200,5,stuff i stuck some pieces of real bacon in the microwave between paper towels to get them and crisp and instead of peas diced up some celery ran the carrot through my salad shooter shred blade and for a keeper,209
126994,333329,5,we loved these croissants next time i will a double batch my kids were fighting over who got the last one i used hershey milk chocolate next time i want to try dark chocolate which i think we will prefer,203
33671,2532724,5,i 039 ve this twice but not this this is nearly exactly the same as quot roast 039 sticky 039 chicken quot also on com but 039 sticky 039 chicken is roasted at 250 degrees for 5 hours and comes out perfect every time it was deja vu looking at this main dish chicken after rubbing inside and out with the spices the other chicken is put into a plastic bag overnight in the fridge i use a reynolds oven bag but the writer uses a quot grade garbage bag quot and i don 039 t care if the epa or someone says that that is okay i 039 m not doing it so now i guess i 039 ll try this and see how it does up against the other chicken,623
45375,45651,5,dip not too fond of using accent but in this it is needed with the dried beef makes a amount more than enough for the bagels we used the leftover dip with bagel chips,166
364742,2000080770,5,this marinade was i didn 039 t have any garlic cloves so i used 1 5 teaspoons of minced garlic instead otherwise i didn 039 t change a thing,140
98867,258154,3,based on the reviews i was expecting a better tasting bread i followed the to the letter the was to follow and the dough turned out to work with the bread looked fabulous but the aroma and taste were lacking it had an unusual almost bland flavor i might try again increasing the cinnamon sugar mixture another reviewer suggested a bit more salt idea,349
62814,350404,4,first time chef followed the directions very hubby seemed to enjoy it too,73
26217,2000512200,5,i modified this because i 039 m a vegetarian without any meat in this it 039 s fabulous i used 2 tablespoons of parmesan cheese and sure there were no chunks from the onion i usually like a sweeter sauce and was surprised at how well this tasted even without any sugar it has a flavor,284
6974,167277,3,i this same about 2 wks ago out of the ball blue book for canning and just opened a jar today while the taste was alright the cauliflower was way too soft i m going to it again and just put the cauliflower in the jars with the onions and then pour the hot pickling juice over it i think between bring it to a boil with the pickling juice and then another 10 min in a hot water bath is way too much cooking for the cauliflower i think i also will use a lot more hot peppers or use red pepper flake in each jar also i will review this after i it again,549
18437,34746,4,just this for my husband he liked it my kids loved it too very to i was worried it wouldn t work when i turned it up side down but it did and it looked beautiful my family put chocolate whipping cream on it yum,210
7417,108681,5,these were excellent they were quick to put together tasted and i liked the fact that they were a little healthier with the whole wheat flour and lack of hydrogenated oils i used them to wraps for tempeh soft tacos my 5 year old daughter said they were the best tortillas she s ever had,286
103110,775207,4,i probably should not rate this because i some changes i subbed in sweet potatoes because dh does not like squash a texture thing i roasted the potatoes onions and apples used water vs broth added garlic salt and a splash of agave nectar for a little bit of sweetness i found the sage bitter served it with grilled chicken and it was enjoyed by all,348
53913,196156,5,i got this from campbells and have been making it for years it is very and quite a for those days when you need a meal but dont want to spend a lot of time,155
270822,2001103802,5,best homemade marshmallow everyone who s tried them rave about how much better they taste than store bought you so much for the,127
317773,1598462,5,very i didn t get a chance to the oil ahead of time so i imagine it will be a better distributed flavor when i do this but we enjoyed it regardless,147
31365,53378,5,this a wonderful and supper for us tonight i had some left over chicken and this was a way to use it i am always amazed at the flavor a can of soup can add for a hearty meal,173
185445,1091015,5,these were wonderful i added just a little more cinnamon for personal taste,75
63071,12572905,2,but not my favorite i usually ina garyen 039 s overnight waffle which by far is my family 039 s favorite these were heavy and not that much taste although i added vanilla and some buttermilk that i had leftover in the fridge i these because i was too tired last night to start my overnight if that happened again i wouldn 039 t bother making these,347
155,1108700,5,i used a red onion english cucumbers and stuck it in the freezer for half an hour and it was,92
267501,2001394162,5,omg i doubled the added onion powder basil and sun dried tomatoes olive oil spread on parchment then took anther piece of parchment layed on top to spread out took my time spreading out and sure thickness was even thru out love this,232
313167,764024,5,this is i did add black pepper to mine,38
81259,2001872329,5,these just as the called for they were gone so fast i will be making more today and my guys are picky about their cookies,121
79469,84524,5,this sauce is absolutely wonderful i have used it one night for chicken wings for my husband and the following night i saved the sauce since i had doubled it and i it for bbq chicken breast it was a hit both times excellent kittencal for saving my family dinners many times i have just gotten to putting down my reviews again keep sharing i look forward to your cookbook,370
264354,278516,5,yum i halved the for the 2 of us left out the celery seed coz we didn t have any have lots left over to share with friends next time here in melbourne there s a local vego burger franchise called lord of the fries clever eh this definitely rivals their seasoning 5 stars all the way,282
19859,1608793,4,this was very i did use low sodium cream of chicken soup but still found it to be a little on the salty side otherwise i loved this the sauce was creamy and instead of canned mushrooms i used baby bellas and they were perfect for this sauce will definitely this again,267
286567,106205,5,this is in the crockpot now and smells marvelous i substituted 2 fresh chicken breasts instead of the frozen and cut everything in half also use lower sodium ingredients from broth to taco seasoning and tomatoes i am so looking forward to trying this will use over baked potatoes and low fat sour cream as someone else has suggested will post my stars soon for this,365
333861,1022323,5,this chili is cheap and to,26
161381,1670458,5,the husband and i loved it,26
189033,457992,5,really dish we ate it as a main course but would be a fabulous side to bbq chicken as well,90
117944,48762,5,deelicious used peppers all 3 colors wow this is so gorgeous and so i used nakano vinegar just a big hit,104
48804,580861,5,this is a very but i was searching for something different my sister in law s mother was czheck and would send baklava to me every christmas but i would swear it had apples in it it was soo very that my family would get worried she had not it that year lol i am still looking for a like this that has the apples in it i used extra nuts in this one because her s was chock full of them for the,392
98896,175827,5,these are so they were a compliment to the steak for a will definately again,76
93843,60288,5,very i found it much easier to melt the caramels condensed milk and butter in the microwave stopping to stir occasionally i used them as christmas gifts for the neighbors and have been asked for the will definately again,220
23738,31261,5,excellent you bergy i wouldn t change 1 thing,45
126311,111291,4,really liked these a lot them as posted but felt they were missing a certain something on my plate i added a few drops of worcestershire sauce to the top and added a sprinkle more of seasoning salt and perfect the next time i these i will add approximately 2 tsp of worcestershire and increase the seasoning salt to 1 2 tsp so much for posting this and unique,359
179903,528935,5,i have never prepared eggplant before and wanted something and i think these will freeze nicely and warm up well i did substitute seasoned bread crumbs for stuffing mix and italian seasoning this was a hit with my husband and i along with my friends,249
35054,122413,5,i found this very and i did it with haddock but i m sure it would taste on any fish i used fat free miracle whip instead of mayo and it tasted i also shredded my own parmesan cheese i ll be doing this one often,210
45809,706191,5,i loved this reciepzaar def recommend it,40
45620,124196,4,this cookie almost has a butterscotchy type flavor it is crunchy with the rice crispys and yet chewy with the coconut when you want to something different,154
213319,856238,1,there are no stars for less than one not at all the texture was unexpectedly confusing as was the taste this has to be one of the worst that my wife excellent at baking has ever i really feel bad being honest with her about this but it is truly yuk,248
180306,478069,5,i love this bread i used 1 cup of white rice flour and 1 cup of brown rice flour and it still turned out and tasted wonderful i love that it is crispy in the out side and soft inside just like french bread is supposed to be after becoming allergic to gluten a few years ago i never thought i would taste bread again but to this i was wrong,339
196952,1973778,5,i this with fresh raspberries and somehow forgot the raisins still the flavors just pop the colors are really pretty but suffer some in the pressure canning process becomes more brown than red purple i pressure canned this in half pint jars for 15 minutes at 15 lbs pressure it might not need pressure canning but i cannot measure the ph and err on the side of safety this is over cream cheese on bagels or served with a rich cut of meat pork roast roast turkey or chicken,472
315162,875884,5,these are i m going to have to use self control to not eat all dozen of them tonight i m grateful for a that doesn t have a lot of sugar also i appreciate the addition of the oatmeal i used a mixture of strawberries blueberries and pomegranate instead of just blueberries also i subbed coconut oil for the butter the only challenge i had was that these are pretty crumbly so it was a bit challenging to get them out of the tins they firm up more after they ve cooled,466
64435,628127,5,very and as written except didn t use cornmeal baked for 25 mins and 2 loaves,77
103424,493002,3,i give these a 3 out of 5 stars for the cookies alone but when i added 26442 allspice cream cheese frosting on top of these cookies they become a 4 out of 5 stars the cookies had an interesting texture due to the cream of wheat but there is not alot of flavor they kinda taste like plain applesauce cookies i added chocolate chips to 1 2 the cookies to them a little sweeter because we didn t use raisins i would these again but definately with chocolate chips or frosting for sharing this it was worth trying,509
338317,1087830,5,these were an excellent addition to my tapas and sangria party menu i loved the idea as much as the onions fun to stuff and the first bite has your full attention loved it,171
53902,47858,3,after a little research on diabetic gourmet i found the original and it notes that there are 24 servings per 8 x 8 pan the brownies are but not our favorite the flavor just isn t as full as brownies with real chocolate that said they aren t bad the texture is almost cakey but a little dry they are a satisfyingly rich coffee color and the frosting glaze adds that little extra something that these guys need to such small servings appealing if you re not concerned about the diabetic exchange my recommendation is to cut these normally to get about 16 brownies per pan and enjoy them with a piping hot cup of coffee or a tall glass of ice cold milk if you are concerned about the diabetic exchange try using splenda as a substitute for sugar i ve had success using splenda in baking and both the diabetics and non diabetics in our family agree that it tastes just like sugar i will be making my next batch of these brownies with splenda and will sub unsweetened applesauce for the oil to cut down on the fat i cook for people with diabetes and heart disease,1058
164379,616341,5,exceptional i was a chef in a brazilian restaurant in rio de janeriro for 4 years and we had a similar using either mango or grapefruit juice rick needham harrisburg pa,168
12591,402279,5,what more can i say than fabulous you so much,45
102154,269899,5,we loved this chili it was even better reheated the next day i topped each bowl with cheese,91
361831,800297,5,my mother in law sends me something similar to this to dip in coffee or tea but it is not sweetened at all with this one i did not sweeten the coffee and it worked out for ramadan tag 2010,188
84957,449312,5,excellent i didn t change a thing i ve never really liked meatballs but i think these taste my kids love them and request them often the meatballs do freeze very well so i usually triple the,190
8995,543029,5,this mousse was it was perfectly light and had just the right amount of chocolate described as chocolate on a cloud by my sister after making it the first time i melt the chocolate in the microwave then place that bowl in the freezer to help it to cool faster by the time the whipping cream is whipped up and sugar added the chocolate is just the right temperature to add for this 5 minute d,391
83061,142613,5,this cake turned out and didn t last long at my house tasted with vanilla ice cream for the super,97
15013,654563,5,this is so and that i am sending it as christmas gifts to family and friends,76
10785,63586,5,i can t tell you how this sauce was it was will worth the time it took to simmer as long as it was suppose to i found after i stripped the squash from the rind the rind itself was sweet and tender instead of throwing it out i pureed it in the processor and added to the sauce for the additonal nutrients i hate wasting,318
220838,226069,5,this is the perfect ffor authentic lentil soup it is very and full of flavor for posting,88
336324,1966160,5,heavenly delicate blend of apple and pumpkin i read then reviews and also doubled the spice i may even add a bit more next time i them i used splenda granulated instead of xylitol and they were just fine they bake like a dessert bread so test with a tooth pick for doneness i skipped the frosting and did not miss it without the frosting which has molasses this is a diabetic cookie,382
50719,618332,4,mmmm these were they weren t too sweet and were so so moist with as many others have noted a cake like texture i managed to sneak in about a tablespoon of ground flax seed to them a little healthier and it didn t any discernible difference i loved the nutmeg sprinkled over the top of the muffin that was the best part next time i them i ll probably add some to the batter so there s more of a nutmeg flavor i baked these for 22 minutes and they came out perfectly i only yielded 13 but i do tend to eat a lot of batter,519
15242,2001314857,5,and turned out i d like to try it with cream of mushroom instead of chicken soup next time,90
436350,2000744656,5,i this the first time for a work pot luck i don 039 t normally get asked for the as i usually bake from scratch but had several people ask for the to this i absolutely loved it planning on making it again today i did intentionally use a bbq sauce that didn 039 t start with high fructose corn syrup as its biggest ingredient i use sweet baby ray 039 s as a hygroscopic element in jerky prep but for this i spent a little more,425
381017,692025,5,wow wow wow we loved this i cut the in half because i only had 3 cups of rice from last night i will this again,111
327591,100185,5,i have this twice now the first time i doubled it and then this morning i quadrupled it i like to have pancakes in the freezer at all times but i added more cranberries and used both nutmeg and vanilla extract and i subbed whole wheat pastry flour for the all purpose fabulous pancakes definitely a to again you so much for sharing,331
25723,109404,5,these were super my son helped with these i did double the frosting i also needed to add an addition tsp of milk to it drizzleable quick,136
72204,929149,4,i had the same problem runny i used a cream and whipped it before i put the nutella and it was till it started to get room temp now i have my cake in the refrigerator hopping it will set up,189
428184,2293423,2,i did not have any luck with this i have a very loose spread as my jam did not set it taste however the lemon used in this tends in my opinion to overwhelm the tartness of the rhubarb it taste more like strawberry lemon jam the jars all sealed well and are now in the pantry just did not get the jam texture,307
29817,119552,5,these were fast and right out of the oven they were the best because of the crispy outside when cool they were soggy but they reheat very nicely i like how the makes a small batch and is not bad for you either esp when subbing lower fat ingredients you,252
166751,510821,4,these were really i have never liked baked beans but i did have a helping of this and it was actually very i will definitely this again for all of my baked bean lovers in my family,180
75285,571308,5,both my husband and i really enjoyed these mexican meatballs it was a change and a way to use ingredients i always have around the house i used pamela s 4292 for the taco seasoning i served it with steamed rice a green salad and fresh tortillas since there s just the two of us i put the remaining meatballs in the freezer for another meal this was in memory of judy jude,371
318100,345884,5,this was i used my own homemade potato gnocchi for this and for the first time ever my husband said how it tasted it will always be my stand by whenever i gnocchi in the future rather than dicing up the onion and red pepper i rough chopped it in my processer to save time and bring the juices out a heavenly dish you,316
96514,539926,5,and so my family loved them and requested more the next day,59
93446,2717575,5,this will be my go to banana bread cake from here on out it turned out super moist not too sweet w right amount of spice the olive oil this so it makes a lot so i buttered,171
256670,2000193576,4,would recommend more cayenne for a bit more of a bite original was a little plan and lacking spice in all i will be using more often,132
50498,21424,5,this makes a very moist turkey breast i used an organic kosher bone in 2 3 4 lb breast from trader joes i did not use butter or cream cheese just olive oil and the rest of the spices it was i the paste of olive oil spices and used a silicone small brush to put it on the turkey as well as under the skin cooked on high for 4 1 2 hours,334
69173,1604675,5,i used turkey instead of beef and they turned out i did need to adjust and use less milk however my husband and i both loved them another home run kittencal,156
54257,41296,5,rating this 5 stars because i am not sure you can a better meatloaf my husband repeated what i have read in previous ratings that he didn t like meatloaf but he loves this all three of my boys gobbled it up too meatloaf of all things too,237
264474,388572,2,just didn t care for it nothing outstanding but was able to use up the broccoli i had in my refrig,98
144837,770980,5,it came together very and cooked up in the crock just fabulous i m having some for lunch today and its even better than dinner was last night you,145
259563,53609,5,this last night cut down the to 4 apples and used captain morgan s spiced rum did adjust the cinnamon accordingly and served with vanilla ice cream this was absolutely think next time i will the full batch and jar any that i don t use for a chelle,247
281881,1691392,5,this really hit the spot for the guy on the go who doesn t want to eat subway sandwiches for dinner it was and crunchy,118
44997,245408,5,this punch was an absolute hit for a brunch,43
13242,394617,5,wow the reviews were right this is such a dessert it was my first time making a flourless cake i am glad i read the reviews though it does come out more like a torte meaning it is not very high and does fall when it comes out of the oven and also didn t remove the springform side until at least 20 min i served this to my husband and my boys with some homemade strawberry sauce fresh strawberries a little sugar and and shot of raspberry juice poured some on the plate put a slice of flourless cake some drizzles of chocolate sauce over the cake and topped with some whipped cream yummmmmy this is a keeper i think i am going to this for valentines day too,657
70562,177857,5,that second casserole didn t last long in the freezer that s for sure this was,78
294128,925054,5,oh man is this i cut the in half and served this as a side dish with a grilled salmon so i left out the chicken i also left out mushrooms just because i don t care for them much i added about a cup of frozen peas too i didn t add that last cup of cream either because it already looked perfect i did add just about 1 4 cup 2 milk to thin it out just a little before serving over bowtie pasta for posting,403
141371,534935,5,yum i use soft brown sugar instead of regular sugar and it makes this amazingly sweet but very very very,104
52757,1077339,5,wow i too wanted to try this because of the pixar show but i was doubtful because i generally dislike squash like vegetables such as zucchini and eggplant i caved and tried this anyway and i am so glad i did i loved it the eggplant and zucchini added just the right consistency,277
50847,581574,5,1st time trying aparagus in my whole entire lie 28 years and this was the first time and loved it to this even the kids thought this was 5 stars to you,151
119804,2536375,4,i this into twelve regular size muffins instead of a cake i used regular plain yogurt since that is what i had on had that them higher in fat content but they were so warm with a glass of milk my muffins were done in about 16 17 minutes next time i will add a bit more cinnamon personal preference and perhaps a few pecans walnuts or raisins this is a keeper,358
402837,2001119500,1,to echo another reviewer that may be but it is not red eye gravy red eye gravy is from ham pan drippings and black coffee nothing else,134
144169,551517,5,this is absolutely and a lot easier than it looks this was my first beef roast from scratch ever and it came out i am definately making this again,146
63785,953790,5,i never buy already tea anymore i double the and i still only use 1 cup of sugar perfect,88
83125,826406,4,i used larger onions and i wished i used smaller ones the taste was really though next time i ll try it with small onions,121

162361,55589,5,fantastic soup i ve been searching for a cream less potato soup and this one is i didn t even need to the roux at the end because it was already thick and creamy and perfect only other change i will next time is to cut the amount of leeks in half five was a bit too overpowering for my taste otherwise wonderful for sharing this one,332
269736,2001588882,5,very amp very i opted to put the powdered sugar on the rolls after they d cooled a bit for a dinner get together i put a fine drizzle of melted chocolate over the sugar they were a big hit,188

314202,2002607111,5,this was fantastic i have family members who will not eat anything with chopped onion or pepper so i had to substitute with onion powder and crushed red pepper about 1tbsp each definitely a new favorite in my household,218

167900,185684,5,i was going to submit this but to sure i didn t double post a i found this one the only difference in this one and mine is that mine uses 1 teaspoon of lemon juice as a dough enhancer this is a very soft chewy bread with a very crust perfect for sandwiches it has a flavor to it and although i have only used light colored beers i am sure darker beer would be just as the beer flavor is not noticable if you don t mention it will go un noticed the beer adds a certain quality to the bread it s a very bread and i highly recomend it it is the only one i have found on zaar like mine a lot marie ha ha just kidding,612
248806,42736690,5,this for thanksgiving and everyone loved it even my daughter who considers herself a cornbread connoisseur i baked it a little longer than the specified but that might be because of my oven very moist i d like to try it with green chilis in the future,251
117026,578846,5,warning if using a bundt pan do not place crumble on the bottom of the pan this turned into a hard chewy carmalized coating stuck in there even with that everyone loved it,171
47174,639907,5,this is a i used some left over honey baked ham from the holidays and this soup turned out really well my husband even liked it and he is not a big soup fan he said it was even better the next day i did add cheese at the end to melt for the,240

40832,936998,5,like alot of other reviewers i added some garlic powder i also added some italian seasoning and lemon juice to the mixture i used smart balance margarine instead of butter and the chicken still turned out wonderful,214

145027,2000344591,5,set this on rapid bake cycle it worked best oatmeal bread,57
34337,477411,5,i followed the almost exactly but i used bread flour since that was all we had on hand which them sort of like a dense tart but i thought they were superb you so much for sharing jen,182

194172,341938,5,this was a wonderful it was to and,34
28549,226294,4,i these with ground turkey and they were quite my family found these a bit too sweet though i ll definitely try these again using ground beef and half the amount of sugar,170
245591,2002267250,5,this is i used six thick bone in chops next time i will do boneless and i will double the sauce mixture as it is over mashed potatoes or rice i didn t have the fried onions so i crushed up texas toast garlic butter salad croutons and used them instead also i mixed all of the sour cream in with the soup instead of dividing it and it was perfect i sprinkled shredded cheddar over all and finished uncovered the last 10 minutes this is very yet can be very elegant this is going into my rotation you diner524 for a comforting casserole,534
179295,1153793,5,i thought this was a i used about 6 cups of crushed berries a little less than 4 cups of sugar roughly a cup of honey and lime juice it was all i had and a whole box of pectin i did blend my berries to crush them which i had never done before and i don t think i ll ever do it again b c it didn t fully thicken like it usually does but it tastes regardless for a,362
178599,98812,5,i fixed this dish for easter and couldn t have been more pleased first of all because it was so and secondly because it drew so many favorable comments a perfect accompaniment for ham,183
138173,98867,4,these remind me so much of onion rings they a snack i will definitely try it with zucchini one day,98
134655,685017,5,this was really i was pleasantly surprised since i don t have the best luck with asian dishes i a few changes i used cubed pork tenderloin stir fried it and added the sauce at the end until it got thick and bubbly i reduced the soy sauce but still felt it was a little overpowering so i added additional brown sugar i was so pleased with the end result i ll definitely use this again with pork or chicken breast,411
65640,243351,5,i ve these many times can t remember where i got the but it really is we often use our own homemade roll and the sauce as directed here really,142
11753,7676,5,soup with a few modifications the thickener is a bit easier to handle if you use a more traditional 1 1 ratio i used 2 tablespoon each of butter and flour and got a lovely consistency in the end a minced garlic clove added depth to the flavor i m not sure why the cook chose to use frozen broccoli when fresh is now available at a reasonable price all year i used fresh and it came out superbly with just a bit of crunch left in the vegetable i also skipped the salt and used chicken bullion instead i ll do this one again on a cold winter night,545
330020,559251,5,my 4 year old son and i these today and they were it called for more ingredients than i wanted to work with but it was well worth it i didn t have frozen strawberries so i used the fresh i had on hand,200

71675,2414501,3,this is a very dipping sauce with a bit of zing it is however nothing like outback points for a dipping sauce though,116
50588,306951,5,i this with a total 1 kilo of meat in the form of meatballs and then pan fried them and served them over brown basmati rice i omitted the sugar and used a processor to mix the meat and spices as well as 2 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar the flavour was these were exactly the right spices balanced so that you could taste all of them but not overwhelming i am south african and loved them and my husband who isn t also really enjoyed them,436
28199,1562071,5,i loved this i forgot to add the lemon juice and it was still fantastic you,75
27398,54020,5,and just the right amount of spice i mixed the potatoes in a 1 gallon ziploc bag instead of a bowl got an easier even coating,125
40365,1253164,2,even after adding vast amounts more cherry to the mixture these didn t have a strong cherry taste to them and therefor the cookies were rather bland,148
11221,163120,4,we skipped the making of the crisps and substituted chips for it it was easier to and tasted just as you for the we will it again,129
129644,237606,5,this was so and so to fix i used provolone for the filling and parmesan to top the crepe since i used store bought french crepes they didn t come very warm after broiling so i ended up warming them in the microwave however the end result was still fantastic a lot for a and fast to fix saulo,291
339453,2523590,5,i am so thankful for your i bought a roaster oven to free up oven space and improve the timing of my thanksgiving dinner the roaster oven instructions for preparing a whole turkey were vague and friends told me my turkey would be moist but would not brown your saved the day my thanksgiving turkey was moist well seasoned and it browned perfectly it was so to prepare i will cook my holiday turkeys this way from now on i highly recommend this for anyone who wants to use a roaster oven and again,496
56117,386022,5,this for bagels is the best and fun to do they taste superb just like the ones i grew up with except now my husband and i them homemade because of this terrific these bagels are a lot better than any store bought bagels or bakery bagels they freeze too love them,262
412094,2002197620,5,picture doesn t do it full justice it looks a little more red than that also added most of a packet of starbucks italian roast via ready brew for a more smoky flavor balance of sweet spicy and smoky what makes it a is that the chili is on its own,246
59636,1762248,5,i cut each biscuit into quarters before frying them to 40 donut holes,69
110686,1220185,5,it yesterday and we loved the crust you,39
161457,2000992191,5,the method is the lesson in this pushing it into the middle the baking powder must do something too and not cooking so long these were the best scrambled eggs i have done in awhile also did a very low cal version for one with egg beaters almond milk 1 2 teaspoon butter dried herbs and 1 2 wedge laughing cow cheese folded into middle and they were too you,356
41156,105111,5,my dh announced this was the best shortcake i have ever yeah i followed your exactly and it was it is a little sweeter than most shortcakes and the additional flavors of brown sugar and vanilla really it stand out in the crowd for a really shortcake,249
143831,1800108098,5,this is a hearty that goes well with coffee and keeps you full for hours my only change to the is the cooking duration i had to cook it for 50 minutes lt br gt lt br gt i love the fact that it used brown sugar instead of white next time i 039 m thinking about adding walnuts,274
92038,145448,5,these are sooooo i added one teaspoon of sugar just a personal preference and some little new potatoes these were so with a slice of cornbread dripping with butter me feel like i was back at my grandmother s table for the,221
217476,73144,5,a friend brought these to camp to share and they were wonderful i m posting because i hounded her for the and will them for sure lovely,135

74760,281257,5,beautiful and soooo for the,27
112624,174955,5,flavor and to i with asian noodles and their texture didn t work out so my fault with the noodle selection no reflection on the but the flavor was super i added more sesame oil and put tons of toasted sesame seeds don t just garnish with the seeds load up i will use linguini next time as instructed know the results will be,324
18185,2182927,5,so and my boyfriend and parents was impressed i used whole wheat flour and ev olive oil pressed into the pie pan nicely i used this for a spinach and feta quiche the crust was not so much flaky but was dense perhaps because of the whole wheat flour this was fine with me for my but i will definitely try to achieve that flaky crust next time i cooked the quiche w raw dough but will either try par baking the crust before hand or bake on 400 as was recommended i baked my quiche on 375 i did have to add a tiny bit more oil and water while mixing but i don t know think this had much of an effect if any,603
95863,2001168835,4,this was the exact from the back of the andes baking chips bag and it needs some salt i wish alton brown would whisk in here and explain why the baking soda is needed too the cookies are most certainly but could be even better,226
161557,631511,3,i used only 1 can of chipotle chiles in adobo 6pcs of tomatillos 3 cloves garlic all was cooked on the pan with olive oil instead of heating up the oven,152
310992,1330315,5,went to another black bean dip for an after christmas party and didn t have the cream cheese it called for so i went looking for a i had everything for and this was it i substituted canned chipotle peppers for the jalapenos and monterey jack for the mozzarella i thought the chipotle s gave enough heat so i left out the cayenne will be with veggie dippers or tortilla or pita chips,382
32541,1419557,5,just this for my family and it was a big hit the only thing i did different was substitute the crushed corn flakes for natural whole grain bran flakes and cut back on the paprika sue,182
46832,781101,5,i always triple this changes other than tripling 1 can green curry paste 1 4 cup dried basil 2 cans diced tomatoes 3 chicken bullion cubes fresh grated coconut makes this the best this is one of the most versatile recipes i love it,231
121064,86049,5,tastiest quinoa i ve tried yet and very,39
93914,171920,3,this tasted but did not turn out as crispy as i had hoped but this was also my first oven fried chicken i might try it again and coat the chicken with something to help the bisquick stick,187
96514,225620,4,these were very and i had everything on hand i these for thanksgiving dinner after a thanksgiving morning request for dinner rolls i half a and let them rise twice before making the rolls and letting them rise for the last time the dough is sticky and it was difficult to create even sized dinner i m sure the more you them the easier it bcomes to eyeball the correct size,372
410797,2754057,5,this was so and i added cajun seasoning as we like spicy it left a taste in my mouth the only downside was that i was tempted to overeat,136
29002,592373,5,this is the most unusual way to cook pizza i ve ever tried but i have to say it s now one of our favorites as i was cooking this i couldn t imagine how it would turn out but the entire dish is almost foolproof for a new favorite we ll be enjoying often,252
66781,503284,4,my first time making my favorite indian dish i didn t really measure the spices used jalepeno peppers which i think cut the heat a bit used 1 1 2 packages of baby spinach and no yogurt but it still came out followed sackville s advice and the pilau rice which was very very,273
165062,289066,5,this is a i it with a red pepper instead of the green to give it a more christmasy look for a holiday party i also them into wraps instead of the stacks to be able to serve more people for sharing,196
119428,51199,5,these are so initially i was unsure about the cheese and sugar combination but i was so wrong i ve never seen biscuits vanish so quickly so much for the,152
190633,367208,5,i doubled the and cooked it on low for 5 hours in a crockpot they ate it all,76
459476,1883178,5,omg i think this is a killer for posting all different kind of frostings really can t wait to this,98
167694,510209,5,dip i used black refried beans instead of regular refried but it still was excellent friends and family cleaned the plate and wanted more,137
28768,362546,5,when i was a kid the local pizza bar my favourite lasgne the shop has long sinced closed but ever since i ve been able to cook i have been searching for a lasgne that comes close to that same one my search is finally over this is 1000 times better than that old lasgne you so much for sharing this my entire family loved it i took the advice from another review and put some thawed frozen spinach thru the cheese mixture and we all loved it,440
110078,368277,5,i loved these and they were pretty to put together it s something you could probably even do in the morning before you leave if you only have like 15 minutes i had mine in my smart pot on low for 6 hrs and the meat pulled apart but was just a tiny bit dry so i would stop at 4 5 hrs probably not sure if i d cook thin boneless chops during a work day probably would be ok to do thicker chops though they basically taste like barbaque i mine with corn and taters and it was very i a double batch and for the next few days i had them for sandwhiches for lunch they were very i used boneless chops and they worked very well i didn t want to dig for bones i also took someones suggestion and used little cider vinegar when i realized i was short on my worch sauce for the,767
24088,41379,5,i doubled the and added 1 cup froz raspberries and 1 cup frozen strawberries along with 1 cup ice and 1 cup water will add a banana next time,141
73440,2002688578,5,haven t tasted it yet but it looks very amp quick i followed the exactly as written but i did add 1 tbs of garlic salt for flavor and mixed the 1 4 cup butter in baked 55 minutes then brushed the top with additional melted butter and baked an additional 5 minutes i also didn t use a bread pan i just rounded the dough and placed on parchment paper on top of a pizza pan came out beautifully can t wait to taste update just cut into it and it is yum i ll definitely this again,476
158079,382999,5,outstanding this was fun to i enjoyed using the preparation method in this in making the excellent sauce the sauce was plentiful and the flavorful meat was super tender everyone at my table young and old really tucked into it saying mmmmmmm and oh my god this is so gooood and so forth,285
221522,611257,4,when this is prepared as written by delilah winder is is very i submitted several changes to the posted by yooper i got the from the network sit and it is,154
211471,19033,5,my son the picky eater had second helpings probably won t use onion nexxt time as the kids don t like it and a bit of salt and pepper were needed but otherwise very,164
69173,1425845,5,these were wonderful and i used fresh herbs from my garden and added sage and rosemary i was missing bread crumbs but used crushed saltines and the difference was minimal my boyfriend loved them half the batch was frozen for another quick meal for two update so over a month later i pulled this out of the freezer for a quick baked spaghetti and meatballs meal i forgot how unbelievable there were couldn t believe i them again,427
11763,1810947,5,i need more stars this cake is so in fact that when i thought about taking a picture of it to go with this rating my husband had already eaten two slices i am still quot experimenting quot with baking so i am always looking for recipes and this one is perfect i didn 039 t have to worry about alternating the dry ingredients with the wet or anything else too complicated i did let my eggs come to room temperature and floured as well as greased my pan and used confectioner sugar and fresh lemon juice for the glaze soooo i 039 m going to have to another one just so i can take a picture of it,593
42564,911706,5,really really like this i use whatever potatoes i have on hand and they always come out,87
108524,1840944,5,i am not a chef by any means but love to cook for friends and family i had this cake page bookmarked for the last 6 months waiting for our yearly fire department cake sale the cake sale is a once a year event where funds are raised to purchase equipment for our volunteer fire fighters anyway deb was not sure that i should try a new and sell it to someone until we tried it ourselves i this cake thursday night which we enjoyed with family friends on friday night i another which was auctioned off saturday night at the fire station everyone who we shared our cake with loved it if you follow the directions you can t miss the cake sold for 250 00,648
463392,125411,5,wonderful soup the addition of carmelized onions added a layer of flavor to a classic it was met with rave reviews from the whole family i used a rotisserie chicken and homemade stock this is definitely becoming part of our regular soup rotation for posting,257
38764,2000982001,2,as other reviewers mentioned i am a seasoned baker the batter did not mix well for me and now i have a tray of brownies full of hard little chunks of buttermilk batter ugh frosting was very,189
292376,448510,5,quite spicy my kids struggled a little with the heat i used fresh baby spinach and also substituted cream cheese for yoghurt as that s all i had in the fridge,158
12199,623572,4,this was very and satisfied our craving for tangy cranberries i baked it in an 8 x 8 dish and it came out a little undercooked i didn t add nuts but i will next time i am also thinking of adding a little lemon extract for a bit of a twist this is definately a keeper for the,274
52488,1802662835,5,it was my first time to cook this dish and all i can say is quot omg quot i love it right away it just tastes like it came from a chinese restaurant and it goes really well with plane brown rice i a few changes in the i used tofu instead of chicken and i doubled the sauce mixture and i used cayenne pepper since i run out of chili pods the next time i cook this i will combine the chicken and tofu i 039 m excited for my family to try this you for sharing this you rock mean chef i 039 m looking forward to try your other recipes,530
26243,745682,4,i forgot that this dish needed to sit for so long in the fridge so i a few adjustments to the ingeidents i used a 24 oz can of refried beans and still was short one manicotti full of filling i also used less water but only beacuase i changed the cooking method since i didnt have time to do the 8 hour rest period i browned my hamberger first then add rest of the ingeidents with the burger into a large zip lock bag and squished it awhile in the mean time i boiled a pot of water and cooked the noodles about 2 minutes less then the directions called for and removed from water snipped the corner of the bag and used it to insert the filling when i poured over the picante i only added 1 2 a cup of water since noodles were mostly cooked baked for 20 min on 350 then added rest of ingreidiants and baked another 15 min all in all start to table it took me just under 1 hour,874
342742,307344,5,i used wheat free tamari for my gluten free son and he loved this quick with a lot of flavor,92
371673,661649,5,super yum these are really fabulous i followed the except for substituting mushroom for green pepper and microwaving the corn tortillas rather than cooking in oil the salsa verde is the highlight of this dish and enough for twice as many enchiladas i will happily this again soon to use the extra the salsa verde ingredients leave out the garlic that is called for in the directions i used 4 cloves you this is a new top 5 favorite in our house,444
261889,460301,5,this icing was so we used it to decorate our christmas cookies it was to use and had very flavor,96
79944,771965,5,over all this was a to keep next time i will add some seasoning as it was a bit dry and the bacon was what gave it its flavor,125
73348,195092,5,excellent for posting i used half skim milk to cut some calories and it was perfect,83
88289,899120,5,this pie is fabulous i was actually doing a search before i posted my bourbon pecan pie and came accross this one the exact same pie so no need for my post i at least 6 of these every year between thanksgiving and christmas at this point i m not sure my family would allow me to come to christmas dinner without one i use dark chocolate chips and just a little extra bourbon 1 1 2 tbs per pie with vanilla ice cream or real whipped cream,437
52154,524030,5,this dish was as a first time making any kind of fish other than tilapia this was an and quick meal served with french style green beans and copycat outback steakhouse chopped blue cheese salad 330740 my boyfriend was really impressed with my next to non existent cooking skills he now wants to try this sauce on my first attempt at salmon,339
110458,2698924,5,this is the best followed some ideas of using 5 dried pasilla chilies for 1 tbs of the powder pasilla chilies are very mild remove seeds and ribs tear into pieces and soak in 2 cups really hot water for 1 2 hr added to blender with 2 tbs of powdered chili 2 cloves of garlic the tomatoes paprika and cumin added 6 cups of beef broth to the meat and then poured in the sauce simmer for 1 hr i did not fry the tortillas to soften but dipped them in the sauce to soften put sauce in the bottom of the pan before adding the tortillas also had additional 1 2 lb of hamburger cooked separately that i added to the tortillas with the cheese onions and a little sauce to them beef and cheese enchiladas this is sauce is incredible this is gluten free with corn tortillas check the package,780
25079,2000759585,5,this is one of my families favorite recipes my mom has been making this out of the southern living cookbook since i was a kid i just wanted to chime in because this is missing the 1 2 c toasted sliced almonds in the chicken mixture that really makes this ah mazing if you want it spicier you can also dice a fresh jalapeno and saute with the onion in the first step very very,375
128952,10320,5,i have this several times with several different variations i like it best with a ratio with 1 1 cream and whole milk many users like the milk alone but it will result in a texture more like dairy cream where as the with the heavy whipping cream will give you the stone cold like results one variation we really enjoy is mint in place of vanilla with vanilla cake mix or chocolate cake mix and chocolate chip cookies i also like adding chopped oreos in the vanilla for a fantastic cookies and creme this had to be doubled for a 4 qt machine and it filled about 3 quarts best i have found so far i did reduce sugar to 1 2 c i mixed it in the milk with a wisk for a minute prior to adding the cream,696
95533,562747,4,i really liked the flavor to this dish the only thing i will do differently next time is thicken the stew a little more it was a little not too much runny for my taste,167
142924,973916,5,this was my first time making risotto and my boyfriend who is italian and i were very pleased i omitted the parmesan cheese and used 1 tablespoon of butter and it was still very flavorful this risotto has a wonderful lemony taste which compliments the leeks and mushrooms loves it,280
26516,1109018,5,this is my three kids ages 5 8 amp 9 asked for thirds we are definitely making this again,89
63080,1407980,5,i love this it is my go to for salmon and i use the frozen filets and find 4mins side on the bbq works perfectly over med heat i this at least once a week with grilled asparagus,177
214189,2735458,4,this taste but the directions are out of order you should the quot bruschetta quot first since you have to let the flavors marry for about two hours then boil the pasta and the balsamic vinegar reduction after which you the chicken and then combine it this is the second time i 039 ve it and although it takes way more than the suggested time,342
14221,640203,5,these are very i used boneless chops since it s what i had and they were tender surprising since my boneless chops are always tough for a wonderful,147
190053,75919,5,i love this it is so rich and decadent but also so and addictive i love getting bursts of the gorgonzola flavor so i add a little bit more of it,144

28908,52663,4,this is an excellent fast chili that beats the stuff from a can all out yet is enough for us novices i substituted chili without beans from a can for the chili sauce the calls for with no trouble at all if your family likes chili and you aren t very experienced or have alot of time this is for you,298
15840,65998,5,instead of the water i used warm tea like my mom always did the french canadian way mmmm,88
26370,1524232,5,i was skeptical when my batter seemed kind of soupy but since the advised that it would be thin i put it in the oven and hoped that the reviews were true this is one of the best chocolate cake recipes i ve come across it is moist beautifully light with chocolate flavor and not overwhelmingly sweet i used a seven minute frosting and drizzled melted unsweetened chocolate around the edges to counter balance the sweetness of the icing this is a that will be saved and passed on the only chocolate cake i will ever need,518
113220,163441,4,the cake was really not too sweet but very flavorful unfortunately we didn t care for the cream cheese icing and next time i ll probably just a butter cream frosting with the chai flavoring,189
100798,2329720,4,i used some fish burgers i purchased from wholefoods it was for sharing the,75
18816,171457,5,i this as per directions the first time but upped all the flavorings the second time around it was loved by all today i it with sesame oil instead of butter rice wine vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and added a t of hot red pepper flakes it was divine for the,263
166453,1537761,5,you fawn512 for the lovely honestly i have been searching for a pandan coconut bread and i finally found it although it wasn t rated i decided to give it a try and it was lovely i it into a loaf the texture was just and the pandan smelled so i used the real leaves btw i added toasted grated coconut to the mix for added texture i ll try it with fresh coconut milk the next time round,384
124608,383795,5,we loved these and had no problems at all i used two sticks of butter and upped the flour 1 2 cup they were buttery and,119

10562,20477,4,i this without a hot water canning pot and it still came out and all my containers sealed i simply used 2 large pasta pots one for the butter and one to boil my jars in anyway on with the review this is very i think next time i will put in slightly less of the amaretto but over all it is a very pleasant taste on my english muffins in the am,342
46059,215414,5,i loved this cake instead of powder sugar on it i put it with a chocolate glaze,79
4437,225118,4,very went with the grilled pork loin chops we had for dinner tonight for the,76
143126,1228848,5,also agreed with the other 5 star reviews this is a dressing i like to blend a couple tablespoons of capers in too to add a bit of extra zing but it s excellent as is,166
22782,241626,5,this is the best homemade spaghetti sauce i have ever tried my husband and i loved the addition of the red pepper flakes it gives it a kick i have always been disappointed with other recipes but this one is the one i won t be using bottled sauce anymore you so much,265
400051,765437,5,i this for my family so i changed the quantities i also realized halfway through that i was out of soy sauce and curry powder so i used 2 chicken breasts 10 basil leaves and 1 cup of rice i omitted the curry since i didn t have it and used 3 tsp of stir fry sauce since it s what i had instead of soy when adding the second batch of water i used a little less than 2 cups and it came out perfectly not soupy at all the rice i used was jasmine and i usually use 2 cups of water per 1 cup of rice since there was already liquid in the pot i reduced the water a bit my husband and kids all enjoyed it and i m talking preschoolers and toddlers and it was super next time i ll add the curry,685
39087,2002258716,5,this was and,12
282407,192799,5,this tonight and it is very with lots of flavor i did use canned artichoke hearts as i couldn t find frozen and used about 1 1 2lbs yukon gold potatoes will definitely this again for sharing,190

33671,1638233,5,i know there are a lot of reviews already but i will never do a whole chicken any other way ever again i took the advice from one review and left skin on removing as much fat as i could pull off and just rubbed spices under the skin it makes sooo much chicken with such flavor and sooo moist i used it for chicken tacos chicken enchiladas and had some just the way it came out of the crock pot you so much for the,413
82997,2001495084,5,i shredded the chicken and added about 3 4 of the creamy mixture to it reserving last 1 4 filled low carb tortillas with cheese and chicken mixture and rolled up placed in casserole dish and poured remaining 1 4 of creamy mixture over the top then cooked as above for keto all the cream and cream cheese give you the fat to balance out the protein in the chicken,362
174026,329304,5,this is the way i my egg drop soup i was happy to see it posted so that i could comment on how and this soup is the only thing i will mention is to use a quality broth such as swansons i have used off brand broth before and it just isn t the same i also add my green onions to the soup as it is heating up because i like them just a little cooked and omit the salt so and i highly recommend this to anyone wanting to try egg drop soup,434

68514,493330,4,this a fresh accompaniment to some spicy grilled chicken and lemon rice i really liked the yogurt addition too it was a bit sweeter than i would have ideally liked though and i didn t use the pineapple and the cinnamon with no other spices it taste a bit like a dessert i think it would be for breakfast but next time i it as an accompaniment i ll play around with the spices a bit and maybe use less honey,406

73846,22504,4,we tried to like this especially since i m such a fan of f f onions but it was too greasy for my taste if i again i will use a milk mixture rather than the butter the flavor was though and i hate to star it down because of personal taste for the i ll keep tinkering with it,273

57831,121684,5,this is one of the best soups i ve ever eaten i used well seasoned beef mince and fried it with a rasher of bacon to provide the drippings required i used 5 teaspoons each of a mild curry powder and 5 teaspoons of garam masala to give the soup some added richness i added the beef and rice about 15 minutes before the end of cooking time this dish froze and reheated well,371

180683,2002130571,5,this turned out since i m stocking my freezer with this i find it better to double it also since it takes so long to i think it makes more sense to double it unless you don t have the freezer space i found myself using this interchangeably as tomato sauce also i just add a little water to it like sauce even more reason to double this to have quantities on hand for both paste and sauce so much,395
39027,629484,5,i love the idea of using the whole watermelon the spices smell and taste like christmas i have now 3 batches that i canned to save as gifts for the holiday season when harvesting the melon i sliced the watermelon in thin strips this peeling off the skin with my potato peeler much quicker i also added one ince of fresh minced ginger to the,340
310086,440579,5,i cannot comment on the cooking instructions because my dh did his thing on the grill but the marinade was really really we liked that it wasn t too asian tasting like some other tri tip recipes we have tried the first time i it i was out of sugar so i used honey instead worked out fine this time we added some bourbon to it i used fresh onion and about 4 cloves of fresh garlic but otherwise as directed yum,409
447487,1802761711,5,simply i feel one can reduce the fat content to half and it less greasy,71

24019,1368530,5,wow omitted onion added probably a bit more garlic and a pound of baby carrots really flavorful tender meat and i think the carrots complemented the flavor nicely this is sort of like a fabulous and slightly different beef stew we had guests over when i this and they were quite impressed,288
381273,37862,2,for sharing lynn this would require a lot of tweaking to suit our taste but there are too many strong ingredients for me to try to adjust the balance among them i let it sit then for a week or so to marry the flavors but to no avail if i were to try again i 039 d cut way back on garlic and increase the oil to form an emulsion i 039 ll report back if i try just hate to give up on a idea i really appreciate your posting this though,433
419300,719622,5,well hot diggety after years of searching for macaroni and cheese like i really love it i ve finally gotten the right this is perfect texture and i think that s always a lot of my issue i like the cheese kind of crunchy on top i m a 105 lb woman and i doubled this for myself in case it turned out to be what i was looking for i ve already eaten a quarter of it i doubled all ingredients only difference i in was to add about a teaspoon of dried mustard not sure whether that a significant difference or not but this is definitely the i ve been looking for,556

143108,54187,5,bayhill i think you should consider renaming this something flashy like super duper apple delight or quick and apple treat i think maybe the current name is a little unassuming cause wow what a surprise i had when i this delightful apple dessert yesterday afternoon not only was it and lovely to look at but it was ridiculously to put together i one deviation from the i used pecans instead of walnuts because i didn t have them on hand i used granny smith apples and cut the cubes quite small the top was crispy golden brown and the inside was crumbly moist just what you want in an apple dessert my to you again bayhill for winning the football pool and giving me another reason to discover such a,699

33944,453828,5,i love these meatballs due to lack of ingredients on hand i substituted crushed dried herb stuffing for the breadcrumbs and 1 5 tablespoons dried parsley for the fresh after browning the meatballs i poured homemade marinara sauce on top and let them simmer covered for a few minutes before serving over hot pasta the meatballs hold together beautifully and have a wonderful flavor bergy for a quick healthy,406
744,1777973,5,i have only ever used frozen yorkshires or the packet you mix with egg and water i always assumed they were hard to since that 039 s what i 039 ve been told but it 039 s a holiday and all the stores were closed so i decided to try this it turned out perfect the yorkshire puddings puffed up beautifully and tasted the only thing i did different is follow reviewed advice and use only 3 eggs and mix the batter an hour or so before i needed to use it i will be bookmarking this,476
213797,802431,5,this is probably one of the best soups i ve ever had,52
182471,735462,5,this is a weekly must have in our home my husband is from oran he taught me how to this and now doesn t like to admit i can it better than him my variation 2 cups chickpea flour,177

353601,1127884,5,we loved this i some additions to the based on some other recipes i looked at i cooked 2 strips of bacon and added it to the beef i then sauteed the onions diced peppers garlic and added mushrooms in the bacon grease with the addition of 1 tbs oil i added un cooked minute rice to the mix as it cooks perfectly during baking and a little mozzarella i doubled the amount of basil and oregano to give a more intense flavor with 15 minutes bake time remaining i sprinkled the top with a little more mozzarella for us cheese and italian lovers i sprinkled on fresh parmesian shavings before eating,593
64897,73951,5,moist and perfect for sunday afternoon coffee,45
33569,2109063,5,very i didn 039 t use some of the ingredients caraway or thyme because i don 039 t care for those spices nor did i use the country gravy i added brown sugar amp a splash of worcestershire to the spice rub and baked them as directed served with a side of sour cream amp chive pasta yum,284
2886,2002601313,4,stuff baked this for 25 minutes in an 8 mini loaf pan everyone loves their personal loaves,90
132765,1501872,5,surprising how this basic is will use for endless garden broccoli also was a balance for the christmas dinner table something and green,135
5170,360127,5,pancakes the i ve used forever because it was the one from mums women s weekly cookbook that she always used is now obselete it makes me feel a bit like i was a deprived child not having these pancakes sorry mum i know there was no recipezaar then i have now subjected these to the ultimate test i cooked up the leftover better and froze them they can be popped in the toaster and resurrected anytime you want hooray,416
93105,386432,5,tasting i did it with whole deboned chicken breasts on top and sprinkled with grated parmesan cheese oh i also sauteed thin sliced portabella brown mushrooms with the garlic and onion i didn t use enough potatoes golden raw sliced enough to fill a 9x9 baking dish almost half way so it ended up more as a chunky potato soup we needed a fork knife and spoon but it was my soup version and the normal version are both on our list of do agains,440
31436,1880665,4,it was but not exceptional,26
206216,1270891,5,they were every bit as as i remembered them i used the deep fat fryer and found that 40 seconds was enough cooking time,119
18651,870390,3,but a bit too salty for me it is but i think i prefer the extra work from scratch for the though,96
37017,2001752194,5,i m a late bloomer to frying turkey i guess it was the tradition of prepping basting using the juices as the turkey bakes blah blah blah but i broke down last year and bought a butterball fryer this year i found this and i too used the remaining spices as a rub after injecting the liquid the salted buttery taste of the skin had my family fighting for it for posting,367
261889,583502,5,didn t the cookies but the icing was terrific for piping with a fine writing tip and spreading inside outlines i used water instead of milk and added extra vanilla plus lemon extract to give it a nicer flavor,208
66023,202865,3,we thought this was,19
437254,1802089064,3,these are phenomenal the only thing i do different when i these are change it from white sugar to brown sugar because the doesn 039 t specify which type to use and use a whole teaspoon of worcestershire instead of half happy eating,231
139283,337569,5,the best raisin bread i ve ever had baked as instructed,55
47120,234847,5,these were the best cookies my kids and i adore them i added a little more peanut butter cause i like it that way dh isn t a big fan of peanut butter oh well more for me,169
490247,2001744058,5,you i added paprika and will also finish it off with chives next time,69
211001,2142930,5,this is fantastic i add a tablespoon or 2 to my beef and ale stew gives a lovely flavour super too with strong cheeses or homemade liver pate yum,145
17891,46513,5,these were to and were a huge hit with chili next time i ll double the amount of cayanne pepper to give the muffins a kick or i ll use hot instead of mild jelly i ll be making this again and again,196
115153,843677,5,we love this it is quick to prepare and everyone of our 4 kids is excited to see it on the dinner table this has become a regular in our menus you for sharing,158
261221,1010338,5,oooohhh soooo it doesn t get much easier than stirring up a batch of these cookies loved them for winter comfort cafe snow queen round 1 10 pot luck supper definitely a treat for anytime but a really dessert idea for a pot luck especially for the kids no forks or spoons to handle and no plates for them to carry kids of all ages can just snag and go lynn it s a keeper,369
238069,597538,5,we love our beef and making ours this way saves on my oven and comes out every time the onions and garlic give flavor to the roast and it s a to follow sure you let the roast sit for about 15 minutes when you take it out so the juices stay in the roast when you cut it gravy too i left the onions in and just used the goodies in the pan added water and cornstarch and in a minute or two i had some stuff to pour over our meat and mashed potatoes we had carrots and a salsd to go with it and we loved it all,506
194745,124876,5,you for posting this as lahey offered it i have this loaf a number of times and always with incredible results i have spent a number of years trying to get the same results with more conventional means two months ago i succeeded with a rose levy beherenbaum and a lot of effort only to discover that the same results were attainable with very little effort and a minimum of time ironically i found the news on rose s web site if you have never a really crusty open crumb bread before you need to try this finally i would not use a 6 to 8 quart container as i prefer a taller loaf i have doubled the and successfully baked it in a lodge 4 qt cast iron dutch oven a beautiful round tall loaf with a crust to die for amandochka and jim lahey,738
73866,748565,5,this was fantastic i never thought i could something so elegant that was soo my husband and i hosted christmas eve for the first time in our new home with my family this prime rib was fabulous my mother isn t one to give a lot of compliments but when she gave a toast to the first prime rib in the family i knew it had to be i cooked a 4lb prime rib cooked it exactly like it says left it in the over for 2 1 2 hours it came out sooo juicy tender and the only think i ll change next time is halfing the salt mixture because i wasted a lot of it i m looking forward to making this dish many more christmas eve s to come you so much for this,639
146558,187349,5,i 039 ve now this a half a dozen times i love it the kids love it the family loves it i this for our easter dinner at work one year people asked for the and now it has shown up at various potlucks throughout the years it is that lt br gt lt br gt my family likes spicy so i add extra chipotles and adobo work people are wusses and they do not find the original overly spicy at all,380
110938,1791394,5,i was very skeptical of this dessert but it turned out super,60
17987,707337,5,this was fantastic i took the other reviewers suggestions and microwaved the squash first to it easier to deal with dinner was on the table in less than a 1 2 hour i added a little fat free half and half and a dash of cayenne otherwise as directed very,252
51630,562422,5,i have never cooked tomatillo s before but i love enchiladas with green sauce so i thought i d give it a go i it exactly as directed and the 2 jalapeno s were just the right amount of heat it s pretty hot which i love i love the idea of roasting the vegetables this was so to and very healthy just fresh vegetables nothing canned i put it over the enchiladas that melvin swifey suggested the addictive green enchiladas this was served with sweet corn cake like they serve at many of the chain mexican restaurants perfect meal with a cold beer,542
8494,121840,5,this is the best alfredo sauce i have ever i followed the to the t and it came out perfect dh says this is so we can use it in anything for a wonderfully sauce,159
190135,38574,4,yum this is a little time consuming but not as bad as i expected i ran out of shredded cheese for the top so i used sliced american and will use it again when i this next time i didn t add the jalapeno but the flavor was lacking something so next time i will be sure to add it i will rate again after a re with the pepper oh i also added green bell pepper since it needed to be used i think that i will do that next time too maybe red bell pepper oh i ll let you know,467
100266,170747,3,this is so much for posting this my picky 3 year old son told me he wanted chicken and peaches for dinner so i searched zaar and your dish with chicken thighs we both loved it the chicken was so tender and the peaches a idea my son asked me when i could this again for him very soon my advice to folks don t skip the vinegar we used apple cider vinegar it really adds to the flavor served it with herb garlic boxed rice pilaf now i ve mixed it all up and can t wait to have the leftovers,487
141885,202661,5,you chef fifi i have been having a craving for this coffee with cardamom that a friend of mine brought back with him from israel about 10 years ago and no one knew what i was talking about this is exactly it a million this is an itch scratched,243
30949,429544,5,for christmas gifts to hand out in australia my dh loves it so hopefully others will did cut down on the sugar as suggested by some,131
26736,14386,5,these were fast and they taste even better then second day if they last that long,81
57213,242007,5,fantastic this is the best marinade i ve ever tried i used chicken thighs and they came out moist and i d give it more stars if i could this is a keeper countrylady,164
114852,263673,5,this was a really i used cooking spray which also this an and as if that was not enough i also placed meat along the edge of the dough rolled a few times and then sliced the logs into cigars i have done this the real way as well so i can tell you that these shortcuts do not take away from this just the time you will use making it,331
131463,478599,5,this is just a wonderful and to my whole family not only enjoyed it but has asked me to it again i used center cut bacon to reduce fat yum reviewed for zwt3,156
144224,391048,5,this is fabuloso i left out the bell peppers and did half lemon juice half lime juice,85
293243,1509649,4,for posting this i wanted something that had no yeast i hate rising and kneading etc i halved the and got 8 i would only 1 2 the filling mix in the future i found spreading it on the bottom of the pan just wasted it it didn t stick to the rolls or anything i was able to work with the dough just fine not too sticky or too sweet after sitting out for an hour or two they get very crisp so i m thinking of perhaps adding an egg or trying a moister to future leftovers more appetizing perhaps i will also lower the cooking temperature and time i d recommend packing them very closely together when they cook so they don t fall over lopsided be sure to grease the pan bottom and sides and here s the best tip ever instead of a knife which squishes down the dough use a thread to cut the rolls slide it underneath cross it on top and give it a swift pull it s like magic,866
110961,444944,5,if you toast your nuts coconut first it really brings out the flavour,69
11217,1650187,5,this was sooooooooooo and really i had an incredible amount of zucchini this year and making zucchini bread was going to automatically me gain 15 pounds i did use my processor to shred it all so it was more like chopped but my kids don t know the difference between this salsa and regular salsa i use a jar of it when i tacos way to get them to eat their veggies,362
57890,1772390,5,these are simply incredible so to and they melt in your mouth in an instant the key is to whip whip whip i use my stand mixer and just let it run for at least 15 minutes it seems like a long time but it really gets the air in the batter and makes them so airy and light such a christmas i ve this since it was posted in 2003,324
32833,217898,5,i was looking for something to have tonight and we grilled these under the broiler and happy holidays,101
101694,485773,4,effort wise this was taste wise it was okay i m not a fan of boxed cake mixes but i thought the pumpkin would overpower the chemical taste although it didn t i tasted the cake again today and it definitely has improved this would be as a last minute dessert,257
53179,1628410,5,these really came out and surpassed my expectations i a few modifications i didn t have any green pepper so i used a red bell pepper and white onion i used just enough bread crumbs to bind them and then rolled them in panko before pan frying my picky 5 year old loved it definitely a keeper,290
99992,2567101,5,luved it will never change a thing this is a for all year round,63
46170,225997,4,this is a very salad dressing that i enjoyed a lot on salad the only reason i didn t give it 5 stars because it wasn t quite to die for,135
12282,483141,1,it was promising but it ended up too juicy it never firmed up and it was way too sweet i m a sweet tooth too,108
137007,254415,5,very used shredded cheddar,26
2781,2811598,5,love this always a hit when i take it somewhere for sharing a soft and chewy cookie with the crunch of the grape nut cereal lt br gt i too did 1 cup butter and 1 2 cup apple sauce which turned out perfectly i also added some chocolate chips which i find makes the cookies even more,281
62480,303446,5,fantastic sooooo yet soooo i have used this several times now i wish i could give it more than five stars it s a keeper,119
234091,896500,4,this is so i didn t have honey nut cheerios so i just put a little honey in it myself the combination of chocolate pudding and cheerios taste together,150
294196,2002198142,5,i read a lot of reviews and used wine and beef broth this was very and not dry at all i sliced it thin just a preference this will be again,139
321715,1925554,5,very to and super you can hardly taste the oats which is a huge bonus for my 2 year old super picky eater only thing i did wrong was use my electric mixer beater instead if the mixers whoops that explains why it took so ling to beat a you will again,249
168722,500014,5,my wife told me to never these again which is code for very often if you have the oil on high ensure you only leave in for 39 seconds or they look like dooky don t change the nearly every review on com talks about how the dish was but how they it ten times better save that for facebook cheers,293
66887,19166,5,this works really well i use olive oil on my hair regularly as an overnight deep conditioning treatment so when i saw it as an ingredient here i knew it would be i applied it to dry hair and put on a plastic color cap while it rested i would definitely recommend holding your head over the bathtub while you re applying this lol also let everything come to room temperature before applying i got a little bit of a shock when the cold stuff hit my scalp very much for posting this i ll be using it on a regular basis from now on,527
163435,1742527,1,these muffins are very bland and somehow despite not having any cornmeal in them taste similar to cornbread muffins i ve had at restaurants they also didn t puff up on top like a muffin is supposed to instead they just ran over the top of the pan so they had a weird flat cap on them all in all a crap,301
80434,278578,5,this stock is fabulous i cooked over stove top and used it to french onion soup,79
22478,304870,5,a that is healthful and goes well with many main dishes enough for several meals,80
82725,211343,5,i tried this one pretty much as stated and really enjoyed the outcome i was initially worried because i thought that the quantity of cardamom suggested would be too powerful but it added just the right taste job mary,216
378778,1909016,5,these are the absolute best cc cookies of all time i ve been making this from my betty crocker cookbook for kids since 1974 and have tried many many others this one is by far the best the only thing i do differently is to upgrade the vanilla butter and salt to quot fancier quot versions i also leave the dough in the fridge for 24 hours sometimes less before baking per the nyt perfection,389
80118,252636,5,i just this frosting for my chocolate cupcakes and it turned out i m excited to play around with it next time to try different flavors so much,142

136546,466903,5,we adore this i use pork tenderloin and pound out till very thin then proceed as directed this is soooo and you just have to put some fresh lemon on top,152
245035,626096,5,this was a fall treat i did have to tweak a few ingredients but like it you said it would the bread still came out i used 2 small granny smith apples gluten free flour 1 c brown sugar a full teaspoon of vanilla egg beaters melted butter and dried cranberries the result was very moist with a fabulously crunchy top and the perfect balance of tangy and sweet you for posting,373
375809,2267910,5,love it so moist with all that zucchini bread and didn t miss the oil or smaller amount of sugar at all fab,107
135050,2002465842,5,warning extremely sweet very but you may bounce off the walls for an hour i used a pie tin and it came out fine also i too microwaved the honey,143
136915,2001351445,5,i eliminated the sugar and added 1 heeping tap of natural organic peanut butter so,82
137725,1118440,5,we used the as written except added some craisins yum my 3 year old likes to help these we rolled them into balls like meatballs for extra fun,142
74875,1226481,3,i found that 2 5 cups warm milk was way not enough liquid for a roux of 1 2 cup butter 1 2 cup flour and i d grate the mozerella next time the cubes simply didn t want to melt when stirred in overall the taste was quite though and my kids went back for seconds just have to get the sauce liquid enough to soften that top noodle layer,333
274036,427101,3,these were just okay for me to prepare however i had difficulty spreading in pan they tasted like they needed some salt sorry i wanted to give them a better review,163
27999,364433,5,i didn t have nearly as much peanut butter as this called for so these muffins were more just chocolate chip muffins i also used regular sized chocolate chips which it more like chocolate chunk muffins they are very moist and extremely yum for sharing,251
38085,2001045345,5,pretty fantastic you don t really have to follow it straight to the dot such as personally i like to one loaf plain and add rosemary and thyme to the other this is a base for quality bread,188
410095,2000387706,5,and tastes like the starbucks version i have tried for years to it at home and i am thrilled to have found this will some to gift this season i did add the suggested additional oil 1 4 c molasses 3t molasses and ginger 2 tsp all else was exactly like the i may try it without the additional oil to see if anything changes you for sharing,337
98453,477411,5,i this cake with a caramel filling and white chocolate icing for a cake walk i also a mini one for at home i thought it was the people who won the cake thought it was but a little too sweet for their tastes so maybe no caramel next time you very much for posting ann,266
51537,328521,5,i am so excited i had stopped making pies because my crusts never turned out right and my husband hates the store bought crusts we loved this crust i am going to use this from now on you so much for such an and pie crust,220
17394,200822,5,this is my standard now i can t believe i forgot to rate it and comment i ve been makingt it for quite awhile now i follow the as is besides leaving out the onion because i don t like them and i add chopped green pepper it really adds something to it and i don t put the sauce on in the beginning i find that for some reason it burns all on the side of the meatloaf so i bake it plain for 1 hour and then the sauce and add it and cook 15 minutes longer hubby and i love love love this meatloaf and haven t a different one since,527
50621,13301,5,this is the best baked brie that i have tried thus far i only one alteration instead of only brushing a small amount of the apricot jelly on the pastry shell i topped the brie with the apricot jelly and added a bit more than the called for that is the way i had seen it done in the past so that is the way i did it i think i m going to try it the other way next time just for variety i loved the brown sugar it gave it a wonderful sweet flavor i used the pepridge farm puff pastry sheets and they were wonderful for a fabulous,526
32384,335606,5,best meatballs i have ever or eaten,35
12337,617558,5,yay i got just what i wanted on this terribly hot day a dinner that was cold and,80
42272,2000619052,1,when is using chemicals from the store liquid smoke being home unless you love chemicals in your jerky no one should be eating this stuff,137
465880,1800118688,5,try to prepare your beans from scratch and you won 039 t have to worry about bpa and the like in the can lining dr joel fuhrman would love this just double the cumin fire roasted canned tomatoes add flavor too definitely add lemon juice and lemon zest as you take the dish off the stove this dish is exceptionally full of flavor serve with basmati rice brown or white,367
14453,16758,1,it is very watery i did not think it had much taste with all the reviews i thought it would be,94
134053,2001355870,5,i these for my family and they were my 3 picky daughters even loved them,72
48588,1101290,4,this dish is incredibly i the exactly as instructed lots of salt and lots of pepper i do not enjoy oily foods so the first issue i had was the amount of oil and butter i think it can be done with half the amount secondly the flavor was but it lacked excitement i added a little chilli and other spices this dish is a base in which you can easily accustom to your taste rita,373
72861,359707,4,you so much this was my first time making beets and i will always bake them from now on this was so highly recommend,116
54752,1186155,5,until now i have not liked any with ground turkey but this meatloaf changed my mind i it exactly as the states and my family loved it there are no leftovers,156
32674,454846,3,really moist but too moist my bundt cake fell apart but the small loaf pans i came out perfectly i used all butter next time i think i ll use shortening and butter i used banana extract and i think it needs more of it,217
27634,844881,5,i tried this for girls night out and paired it with another i got off this site pesto chicken therefore i eliminated the chicken from this the girls loved it and all stated it tasted like something you would get in a fancy restaurant i loved it,244
50827,898893,5,i have this often it s one of those perfect summer dishes it s even better when everything comes fresh from your own garden one of those tastes i look forward to,161
127740,166623,5,love this we have tried it several times now with different berries the only berry i didn t like it with was strawberry even though we like strawberries just didn t come across as as the blueberry for the,204
218459,1108191,3,well this was really but it was a bit bland and not really creamy a bit gritty in fact still the whole family ate it it just wasn t what i was hoping it would be,161
280212,1800110665,4,turned out this is definitely a very and hearty stew also gluten free if your love spices i would add more garlic amp more herbes spice for a little more of the flavour to come out i sent in my picture for posting hopefully it gets posted,238
28667,1118156,4,this was my husband used to eat something similar growing up and was very pleased with it the only thing i would change next time is that i would omit the beef bullion it was a very noticeable taste and a bit too salty i used herb ox brand,239
364268,31521,5,these were really them on a rainy night followed your directions and they turned out you,88
43509,49561,5,omg i just love these they are to freeze i added chocolate chips about 2 small hand fulls and they tasted just like mimi s cafe muffins this is a big keeper if anyone wants to perfect portion them try to use 3 4 of an ice cream scoop i think next time i am going to skip lining the muffin tin with paper and do it bare,318
268528,106682,5,this an excellent liver just sure not to overcook like my mom and maybe yours,77
8624,349476,5,my kids loved this they look exactly like the ones in the anime movies they see i will try this next time with sweet rice i bought from an asian grocery i found for the,168
350179,310001,5,tried this tonight for the first time i was looking for a that was using what we had on hand using up the chicken breast in the fridge this did not fail us you so much for a and moist,183
31128,329304,5,this is absolutely perfect i can t express enough how much my entire dinner party loved it just the right amount of sweetness yet you can still taste apple the perfect blend of apple pie and apple crisp yum,206
51645,45566,5,this was sandaidh trouble free and very more ish i added a carrot and 2 stalks celery both grated to cook with the beef for added vitamins and because i like the taste will certainly this again,193
14680,245301,5,this was i can t believe how fast and this was to i did follow volleygirl27 s advice to crisp it up put it in the oven at 250 for 30 minutes stirring it at 15 minutes i highly recommend volleygirls27 s advice we wouldn t eat this if we hadn t done that,252
463255,1269180,5,after all that i forgot the lettuce leaves so ours just ended up being served over rice and as my husband doesn t like green beans i put snow peas bok choy and red capsicum in with it instead but it was perfect blend of sweet with subtle sourness and not sticky our 10 month old liked it too,291
313512,461428,5,i have to admit this looked a little scary when i it it has tons of jalapenos a really thick layer of cheese and a little egg poured over the top however it has a taste especially since we love cheese and spicy hot i only used a 12 oz jar of jalapenos because that s what i had on hand and it was more than enough heat for us definitely not for the faint hearted weekend cooker i will this again,395
87388,329251,4,my sister in law recently this for me it is i think she used white sugar i m not sure but either way i liked it she called it pms candy,135
289337,742802,5,this was fabulous i did add some extra veggies because i was using it as an entree but i didn t alter it too much what a but you so much for sharing reviewed for pac 2008,170
32522,567565,5,my husband and i loved it it was so we again 4 days later for a last minute guest for lunch it will be in my to go from now on,126
29232,599466,5,i ve this many times and it is definitely a crowd pleaser i always keep warm in a crockpot for serving,102
142840,190230,5,these have a wonderful earthy wheaty taste that i ve grown to like they are chewy soft and have just enough sweetness to balance the wheat and oats i used king arthur brand white whole wheat which has a more mild flavor and replaced the white chocolate with organic semi sweet mini chips this is definitely going in my again list as it is more wholesome than your standard blondie and it makes the house smell soooo midge for a treat,433
14701,31497,5,the first time i this it boiled over so the second time i used a larger pot and it was perfect i added some carrot slices because i like the look wonderful much easier than the oven baked,187
122355,310178,5,these were really really 2 for dinner tonight skipped the tomatoes and bell pepper in dh s because he doesn t care for them sauteed fresh mushrooms in butter with some chopped yellow onion i wanted to use then sauteed the bell pepper for me in the mushroom drippings i also added some cooked crumbled bacon to the filling i added the cheeses to the filling instead of putting on top then folded the egg over and let it cook a moment longer until the cheese melted some when plating i sprinkled the top with some grated parmesan and green onion tops dh and i both loved this even better i finally an omelet that looks and tastes like an omelet until tonight i ve always been omelet challenged kittencal for a that finally let me a really omelet,743
76821,41799,5,oh dancer i think i have found my new favorite sandwich snack i am eating one of these as i type this review i used 2 slices of white bread 4 slices of swiss cheese 2 on each slice of bread placing over the edge of bread slightly so the bread didn t burn under the broiler covered with slices of ripe pear unpeeled and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar what a treat for a keeper in my house,386
27570,1802399267,5,these tonight and they are will definitely them again ten minutes is plenty in my oven i actually used old fashion oatmeal instead of the quick cooking oatmeal and they are that was what i had so that is what i used,215
3579,1352827,5,super and my hubby and sil loved it very as well i used honey crisp apples and it was perfect i love apple crisp but some recipes don t have enough crisp this was perfect,170
98125,840020,5,excellent for a tailgate served room temp the leftovers the few that we had were warmed up the next day for breakfast only used 1 1 2 pounds cheese one pound of which ws lowfat,176
281304,246833,5,excellent exactly what i was looking for just the right amount of coating not too heavy perfect you for sharing,111
46232,688566,3,just found these okay did an ammendment instead of pizza sauce i used more milk and roasted pepper pesto the muffins were moist and not dry like other savoury muffins i have tried but i m not sure if i will try again for sharing,228
113840,205783,4,i defrosted my freezer today and unfortunately some of my frozen bananas defrosted as well but fortunately i found this which was a bonus as my dh s diabetic friend was over helping install some insulation in our house so this was something that he could definitely eat the oat bran was i reckon if you this with wheat bran it wouldn t be the same too scratchy in taste as opposed to the softer texture of the oat bran i used the whole egg as i only had one left and added vanilla like a previous reviewer i also added the raisins to the wet ingredients and then mixed the lot together important not to overmix muffins or they go tough according to the mother of new zealand muffin making alison holst these muffins were lovely especially when you got a hit of the banana but i think next time i would add just 1 4c dark brown sugar or even just a few tablespoons we re not sugar fanantics either just a comment by the three tasters my bananas were very ripe as well i think if you used normal yellow bananas this wouldn t taste as as you definitely need the natural sugars from overripe bananas we also agreed that these did need the raisins or sultanas just to add that little extra for such a healthy it s to be able to offer the hard working guys around here such a healthy filling snack,1291
485328,2001249838,5,this was really love the flavor i followed the exactly as written i also added potatoes but i don t think it changed what is an tasting soup you so much for the,160
17751,467345,5,these were fantastic my husband and daughter have been nagging me for months to find a way to them at home since aunt annes opened in our local town this produces very authentic pretzels we the dough up to step 3 the night before and refridgerated overnight we also brushed with melted butter before baking and then brushed them again when they came out of the oven and then dipped them in a mix of caster sugar and cinnamon so that the topping did not catch in the oven yum scrum,480
497382,2204786,5,what a meal,11
77417,940103,5,worked out i think these would be best for biscuits and gravy i was looking for something for a breakfast biscuit sandwich but will keep these for gravy and biscuits however i also patted them out since i felt i would had to add a lot of flour to the dough to roll them out,273
78340,47175,5,this was quick and tasted my dh said it tasted like something you would find on a bar grill menu instead of using cubed chicken i cooked chicken in a crockpot while i was at work and shredded it when i got home it was alot of chicken so i ended up using 4 t of butter and tons of franks hot sauce i just kept adding to taste we like it spicy i used boboli thin crust for the crust and only about 1 4 cup of blue cheese dressing it was super you for posting,456
37302,35617,5,i ve these for years and yes they are super they keep very well in an airtight container or ziplock as well just be warned that the longer they sit the spicier they get,168
25596,2001630864,1,okay but not i doubled the catsup though maybe my fault one star sorry,70
11278,714762,5,the only change i was leaving out the olives dh doesn t like them and adding a large tomato cubed my dh loved the cheese in this,128
522400,2834004,5,now that s my kind of bouquet classy,36
138754,431716,5,oh much i have tortillas but didn t know how to get the flavorings this will be terrific i will also take the advice of fairy nuff add a bit of tomato paste herbs your basic is very similar to one i use with the exception of using canola or olive oil for the fat works surprisingly well again,292
202262,1944859,3,the pesto works well with the salmon but i don 039 t think that the nuts added anything other than texture which my family didn 039 t like,138
115432,271911,5,the best muffins ever came out big and the taste was out of this world so much for this out with all the other banana recipes this will take it s place for the,159
98723,160338,4,this was ok the combined taste of the nuts and lime juice was not that appealing overall it was pretty to but i think this might taste better if it was just the lime and had no nuts read my recipes on my other account chef mysterious chicken,241
392314,1753585,5,so close to chili s its unreal so much,38
122042,123444,5,very took summerwines advice and left out potatoes had leftover ham from sunday dinner and added it to the soup the slight smokey flavor the soup even better i was snowed in and had to use whole milk instead of the cream the soup was still,239
289757,2002196958,4,if you want to add extra crunch sprinkle pebbles over the top once you have transferred them to the pan then while they are still warm gently press the dry pebbles into the top you can actually up the crunch factor quite a bit but once they cool down you need to keep them someplace and dry i also find you need to adjust the based on the humidity in your area so you re better off not adding all the pebbles at once instead start with about 3 4 then add until you get the right consistency,490
66697,239660,5,i ve this for the past two years and it s become an absolute staple in the house i love love love this relish,109
9272,2000449174,5,is i added black beans and corn to mine phenomenal i used mostly ingredients from my garden and it came out pretty spicy i 039 d say medium hot using the cup of jalapenos i canned two quarts then added the black beans and corn which another two i 039 ll definitely be using this again maybe add pineapple or grill the veggies first for the next one,348
99094,2002694094,4,i started making these and was also appalled by the 2 cups of sugar so looked through some reviews to see if people had modified and decided to halve the sugar and i used 1 2 cup of oil and 1 4 cup of apple sauce i only added 1 cup of chocolate chips and replaced the last half cup with walnuts these turned out and definitely sweet enough with the 1 cup of sugar they did not spread very much for me but had a crispy top somewhat like a brownie it has a dense cakey flavour i 6 and froze the rest in balls so hopefully will bake well from the freezer,551
278282,846074,5,love this you i this using all the ingredients including full cream i also measured the cream out and then put it in my freezer for a half hour before making the frosting to sure it was and cold i think that a difference because it was really thick frosting,257
29932,83178,5,forget the fat free stuff this is with real butter and regular hollandaise sauce mix i find that knorr has a better flavor than mccormick my kids ages 1 5 loved it and my mother in law asked for the,198
192197,801216,5,this is really my husband loved it soooo much that he asked me to it once a week adding that he thinks it s one of the best dishes i ve ever i also added some baby bok choy and snow peas for a little variety,207
25518,487703,5,1st time cooking turkey in crockpot will always cook that way in the future everyone loved it i cut orange lemon onion up to fill the cavity and garlic butter under the skin breast was 8 5 lbs and barely fit but cooked 1st hour on high and 6 hours on low it was perfect and juicy thx for posting,295
95311,2222119,4,really for homemade noodles family really liked them as well they were just right not doughy or mushy in addition they were very tender noodles also,148
203857,248913,5,i haven t used store bought breadcrumbs since i came across this i use all left over bread to these and always have a batch on hand so much for sharing,151
19056,2002503516,5,solution is bake in a 9 by 9 greesed pan and bake less time you can tell when its done by the touch makes bakers know the touch to bread also i added a few red pepper flakes to the top not a lot like 2 inches apart to get a tiny kick to the bread i never go by a recipie i always add my own thing it turns out,309
37548,1020362,1,i followed the instructions which did not instruct to wrap foil or do anything other than to place cheesecake pan straight into water it was my first time so next time i will not place in water disaster and waste of money,221
11266,1281080,5,i d never even heard of this method until the other day i agree with others now i will never a turkey without brine again i used it for our thanksgiving 3 lb turkey breast only change i was no allspice cause i didn t have any and i added some cumin cause it s a taste we enjoy i put it in a gallon size zipper bag and let the turkey sit in the brine in the refrigerator for about 9 hours deliciously moist and flavorful turkey breast i ve turkey breasts before without brine and it is usually pretty bland and dry this was dib s,528
354549,352005,2,was not very happy with this i had to play around with it a lot i had to use two cans of tomatoes otherwise it would have been dry there was virtually no flavor so i added salt pepper and italian seasoning also my family agreed that it would have been better to mix the cheese in with the gnocchi instead of putting it on top then sprinkling parmesean on top to broil i give it two stars as a starter,400
396674,2357565,5,this cauliflower is it was to too i will continue to use this far into the future,81
164422,332211,5,what a salad didn t have plain white wine vinegar so i substituted raspberry white wine vinegar and it was fantastic also used splenda like another reviewer did also eliminated the butter i just browned the noodles almonds and sesame seeds in a pan sprayed with a bit of pam i know this is supposed to serve at least 10 people but dh dd and i finished all of it it yesterday for dinner and dh wants to have it again today can you tell this is going to be a regular at our house,477
352812,343228,5,wow i was so impressed at how and authentic this tasted i did use fresh ginger and fresh garlic i didn t have lemon preserves so i used the juice of half a lemon and some lemon zest this really was a spectacular dish even my two year old loved it you for posting such a wonderful i really really loved this one will be making again and again,341
81697,1221773,4,a little heavy on pineapple cut in half,39
13982,136004,4,we served these to our guests grilled in tin foil with the top open and they came out moist and i think next time i will use a little less honey,144
32850,348546,5,changed the white wine to orange juice and served it up with veges stir fried in soy and oyster sauce bloody,108
179846,1214462,5,very and vegan,14
211379,429217,5,the perfect culinary canvas not only is this on it s own but you can be creative with sauces i used more liquid smoke probably 4 tbs and i couldn t easily find hawaiian sea salt so i used penzey s shallot salt instead when the pork was done it had a tender flavor without being salty and there was a very subtle smoke flavor next time i will place garlic in each of the slits for posting,387
41313,1052207,4,really a 4 1 2 star but they weren t that flavourful i wimped out and didn t use all the curry paste as i wanted to taste more than heat i couldn t seem to get them to brown at all but i d try them again,203
444819,485373,4,i only added the garlic and cracked peppers to the prime rib and roasted as instructed it was wonderful the horseradish sauce was and loved by everyone it had a bite but not too overly strong looking forward to making it again,226
189820,2079644,5,followed as noted it was a huge hit everyone loved it will be making this again soon,84
10712,1122988,5,wonderful flavor and to mix up even my husband liked them and he seems to be quite picky anymore took quite a bit of prep time for me i did not flip mine over as 1 1 2 in of oil in my pan covered these to the top and i didn t want the edges too browned will definitely again,274
50849,945540,1,i them for a topping to a carrot cake you for sharing,53
15936,430188,5,this was excellent i took the advice from hybrid cookin and added the 1 4 whiskey to the batter gooood,102
33752,210738,5,my dh said this was as or better then any french onion soup that he really liked in restaurants mizznezz,104
67256,1002902,5,growing up my husbands mom would always buy him the entenmans banana cake with chocolate frosting i would get it at the store for him every now and then up until they discontinued it a few years ago ever since then ive been trying out recipes but none came close they were more of a banana bread consistancy after finding this i was sure id found a winner and i did hubby just loves it its even better than the entenmans cake i did use the lemon milk trick for the buttermilk and cake flour instead of reg i also did 1 2 cup of butter with 1 4 cup of oil instead of 3 4 cup of butter i think it it that much more moist it 2 6x6 square pans at 300 gas oven and i did the freezer step and topped with whipped chocolate frosting my family and i are very pleased with the cake you so much xo kaila phx az,800
96098,156460,5,i photographed the complete product i hope it will be posted here it was excellent the crusty edges while baking are very i used italian seasoned bread crumbs although quite salty next time i will use less salt you for this,223
32618,1520681,5,in the words of rachael ray yum o these are i drizzle olive oil on a sheet pan and then drizzle it over the meatballs bake until browned and they are perfect i one batch and then divide it into thirds keep one third for that night or the next and then freeze the other two works perfectly time saver,299
155988,548406,5,rub marinade it doesn t overpower the meat at all the meat just has a light flavor none of the flavors dominate but rather blend together nicely i would definitely suggest using this on higher quality meats for the rub,218
132600,1133603,5,very i this with tilapia and i used cilantro instead of parsley and it turned out,81
97606,823306,5,just served this this morning to my whole family extended included with homemade biscuits it was a huge hit i added a little worshteshire sauce and it was absolutely,165
177072,1273282,5,this crust is the only thing i ll change in the future is to cut the down because it seemed about 25 30 too big for just one pizza maybe my measurements were a little off trying to convert to metric but if the crust had been just a tad thinner it would have been perfect i also added the corn meal to the crust after the first baking would you believe this is the best pizza i ve had in 2 years in argentina the pizza here is too thin with few toppings,452
107133,1923034,5,this is a go to for brunch for guests i use the refrigerated hashbrowns found near the eggs in your grocery stores my favorite combo is bacon gorgonzola and asparagus or feta mushrooms and gyro meat,198
99564,515278,5,a soup i didn 039 t add a couple of vegetables i first sauted the onion carrots celery leek and garlic before adding the lentils and broth also added extra fresh parsley and 1 tsp dried basil and oregano i added some sauted mushrooms and the spinach at the end will this again,276
176443,152178,5,no fail it s been requested i bring it to practically every family gathering i don t dare reveal how it is,106
154576,851405,5,this is wonderful we have a new everyday bread this is soft and sweet but not too sweet it makes toast and wonderful grilled cheese sandwiches just to it healthier i switch one cup of flour to whole wheat flour i sometimes add a tablespoon of vital wheat gluten if i have it on hand it still is light but has a little more fiber,328
239681,598340,5,i was in search for a for something fresh to put over my tortellini and this was perfect i left out the capers because i m not a huge fan and i used diced tomatoes from a can because thats all i had on hand for posting this and giving me a new pasta to love,257
10385,19816,5,hey everyone im a young man from new zealand and have been brought up on lolly cake my advice is try it its so and so to peace be with you all,142
152643,2007679,5,wow yes having to grill the chicken in taco seasoning does add an extra step but the flavor of the grill and seasoning on the chicken is what makes this extra i didn t have ready taco seasoning on hand so used kintencals on here yum yum yum oh i think adding some black beans would have it just a touch heartier for my husband who thinks of soup as a starter not a main dish,374
41829,25045,5,this coffee cake was so and the wonderful aroma while it was baking was so mouth watering please keep posting your family favorites this one i will be making over and over again you very much betsy502,200
58067,72071,5,my husband grilled these pork chops on our outdoor grill over the holiday weekend they were fantastic i loved the tangy sweet sauce and juicy meat my entire family was impressed and my husband was blushing with pride for making him look,236
87967,866298,5,omg theese are soooooo we all loved themm you so much for sharing,65
8060,25113,3,this took no time at all total of 20 min maybe however it wasn t i think oven cooked meatballs taste dry regardless of the fact on this particular day this came in handy,169
11530,17608,4,quick and absolutly what more can you ask for bergy,51
25456,134586,5,this bread is exactly like outback s i the dough in my bread machine then finished the last rise and baking as the directs this bread doesn t rise like other breads and i actually thought i d killed the yeast it s very moist and flavorful you gotta try this,257
171340,474917,5,i have been feeding this to my 2 pugs and my bichon ever since all the pet recalls their coats are so healthy and shiny also they have each lost about a pound since starting i do add some ground beef including the drippings and some olive oil to the mix to help them not lose weight too quickly which i was advised to do by our vet a wonderful receipe,351
39897,194457,5,first try they came out fine these are they are just like the fries that we usually have to drive 27 miles to have we are fortunate to have an old fashioned diner farily nearby however now i know i can their fries at home too,225
74958,239788,5,always a huge hit with company i a pan of brownies put them in the frig mixed up this cheesecake without the crust spread the cheesecake over the brownies put all of it in the frig after it set up about 2 hours i drizzled melted chocolated chips on it nothing betther than chocolate brownie and cheesecake together i have tried other brownie bottom baked cheesecake recipes and the brownie ended up either burnt or undercooked this works out you for your posting even my sil who can t boil water can this with results,517
29175,66899,5,the first time i this i followed the as it is and it was so it really hit the spot and satisfied my chocolate craving i it again today but i didn t have the pie filling so i tossed some blueberries and raspberries from my freezer into a pot with a bit of water and cornstarch and boiled it then i added some jam to my own friut filling wow it was soooooooooo for the perfect pms,378
125986,314487,5,i this for a greek themed party i used a flavored feta seasoned with herbs and omitted the walnuts everyone loved it sitting overnight does do the trick do not cut the time short it won t do the justice,202
185170,69303,5,you for a passover i these for a side dish for one of the seders to prepare ahead and freeze it worked out just and the presentation on a platter was very,154
30572,1625948,4,this was very i only used half of the salt and doubled the garlic and my ground meat was half beef and half turkey but that s because i didn t have enough of either one for a whole loaf next time i ll try it with just beef also i think a little thyme would be a addition and if anyone is concerned about the chili powder turning it into a chili loaf stop worrying it wasn t detectable but i m sure it would be missed if it was left out,435
64972,846703,5,first found this in my pillsbury cookbook and have been making it for years it 039 s always a hit it is a very large cheesecake and the sour cream topping will start to turn yellow after about 5 days really too big for just the two of us but is a treat to take to parties,271
228343,27702,5,for posting this is a really i used a 1 4 oz package of pudding i m trying it with neopolitan ice cream sandwiches for a weekend bbq,132
27383,398905,5,this is so to i used diced tomatoes and green chiles from a can b c i didn t have fresh ingredients in the house it was still even my finicky fiance loved it you rav we re looking forward to more of your mom s favorites,219
384584,774357,4,this a that i first saw in one of jill connor brown s sweet potato queens books dsb is right it is addicting and fat and calorie packed too sometimes i ll toss in some broccoli just to myself feel a little better,212
108580,5672,5,and reheats well,16

171150,1273226,5,sooo i kind of combined this with a paula deen egg i found i used some frozen diced potatoes with peppers and some crumbled bacon to the eggs i added a dash of milk and dallop of sour cream i was supposed to add cheese once they cooked but i forgot even though i whisked the sour cream into the eggs it still held together kind of and i could taste little bits of sour cream which was really with the potatoes one of my favorite parts was the lack of dishes i had to do when we were done i just wish i had more because there were no leftovers,542

321823,204124,5,i love my chips on my sandwich i put them on just about any kind of sandwich have done so since i was a kid it kind of helps with portion control since i don t eat any extras after i have put the chip layer on my sandwich it is fun to mix up different flavors of chips sandwichs too dorito s are too,299
362742,368176,5,this is a we ve been making for a while and we love it it s our babysitter s favorite sometimes she requests the pie instead of money our little girl isn t to crazy about the crust so we give the extra filling to her over vanilla wafers or pound cake either way,261
281973,1990492,5,this was and very my hubby loved it i substituted some chopped leftover ham for the sausage and used rotel tomatoes instead of the regular tomatoes and hot sauce,161

180306,1281638,5,absolutely i just turned gf and this is the only bread i ve tried that actually looks feels and tastes like the real thing for giving me bread back i baked it in a muffin tin for smaller individual servings,206
201807,726560,5,scrumptious i left out the semi sweet chips and added an extra 1 2 cup of white choc chips instead next time i will add more cranberries just because i love their tangy taste with the sweet chocolate i almost missed the almond extract because it only says to add the vanilla in the directions i caught it when i went back to read how much vanilla to put in mine turned out thin in the middle too so i need to fix the temp for the next time i them and i will definitely them again i m adding this to my favorites section of my box,529
19066,613250,5,this is simply the loveliest dessert i ve had in ages i this exactly as written i had to hide it from hubby so there would be some left for the guests it was by itself and i served along side chocolate cake chocolate icing and it was incredibly wonderful together,263

115276,2002260808,4,ok so just wondering do you cut long or round,45
29493,760391,3,followed doubled sauce for a 5 4lb roast i personally didn t care much for it but i m not a huge meat fan hubby thought it was too sweet and then the company we had loved it so i guess it depends on the tastebuds,212
16850,735698,5,i love this cake it is an unbelievable scratch cake i used 3 c self rising flour and omitted the baking soda also not crazy about nuts so i substituted some coconut and it was scrumptious i wilton s buttercream frosting as i was out of cream cheese this cake is superb,268
14740,950653,5,this is by far the best cheescake i have ever tried it is really to and the results are beautiful lennie for such a,115
8634,768039,5,very basic very the key is using a quality e v o o the addition of red pepper flakes makes this sing and the possibility of variations using all those little herb clippings from the garden is endless pat,203
310395,1576373,5,no tweaking here it tastes like the real deal to me i no longer have to go to micky dees to purchase there 039 s now i can enjoy it anytime by making it myself and save a few bucks coffee and for posting this i look forward to making it again,242
32966,463763,5,wow this was i actually got the from my latest everyday with rachel ray mag but wanted to pass it along to someone else so i came on recipezaar to see if anyone had anything similar posted and this is just like it only a larger quantity maybe her editors saw it and decided to share with the world this did not even taste lke cauliflower normally does and my kids ate it without insisting on tons of butter or cheese i am definately making this again and will try to snap a photo before it gets inhaled,502
128593,2705701,5,love these muffins the second time i them i with 2 cups apple sauce i doubled the batch instead of oil they r cooling right now so i will give update when i taste but they look,176
101954,2525017,5,my husband is a southern boy and reply enjoys his pecan pie we met in new orleans and pecan pie is everywhere we it a point to get a slice wherever it is offered needless to say we ve tried alot of pecan pie this is truly the best we ve left the south behind and this particular pie is scarce up north not any more i three pies this thanksgiving and we are eating our way through them and enjoying every bite also i got a lot of compliment besides my hubby this pie is a hit,474
135870,2001100855,1,3 hours later and still no rising this is a dud,47
13729,79219,3,these had flavor but are very crumbly so i ll keep looking for the perfect brownie,82
334210,120891,5,i 039 ve this several times now fast and last night i put some tater tots around the fish no foil over the and it came out perfect,130
127961,890509,5,this was quick and the taste was so for my picky eaters i have two daughters who are 17 and 14 years old and they were amazed how well this turned out my 8 and 2 year old sons were equally impressed my husband and myself were excited and pleased with the dish he was so grateful that i found this website by accident this site has the most wonderful recipes for a new family dish i used red bell peppers instead of green i just wanted to add color,447
313344,1269180,4,worth the cooking time rich and comfort at its finest just be warned if you 039 re counting calories as i am the calculator on com hasn 039 t counted the sausages in its nutritional facts the real calories for this dish are about 630 rather than 257 noo maybe if you just entered the sausages as pork sausages it 039 d correct a small quibble and more my problem than any actual issue with the dish,398
97496,1575360,5,the only snickerdoodle that has ever worked out for me all the other ones had too high a ratio of cinnamon in their cinnamon sugar and ended up tasting too soapy to me the only modification i was adding 2 tspns of vanilla extract and i ended up with wafer thin cookies that were just the right combination of texture soft and chewy and flavor sweet and buttery,360
198485,403428,5,this was really i used 1 1 2 lbs meat and the amount of sauce was just right also used 1 2 a bell pepper and one small onion cooked with the ground beef we will definately again,177
475374,2202736,5,these were the perfect little appetizer for any party the crunch of the potato along with the sweet fig and bacon was unbelieveable everyone must try this you won t be disappointed,180
22829,191963,5,this was wonderful i did forget the red pepper flakes and added a few chopped onions from another dish i was preparing and it still turned out my husband fixed any chances of leftovers,184
344781,714866,5,just plain it twice in the past month and i am ready to it again so much,72
129725,439287,5,this is excellent i it up with best foods low fat mayo when i it again i want to do it with the sour cream it is a thin dressy i love thick creamy dressing for anyone who loves cilantro or garlic this is definitely a keeper for posting it,238
11799,1317864,5,this is an excellent with a not too sweet cream filling i have to say i liked my own cooked and cooled fudge frosting better than the canned but i am a chocoholic i also like the butter chocolate cake mix for that really moist cake that can stand up to all the layering filling and frosting i will continue to this and plan on trying it as a tunnel in a bundt cake the filling will probably enough for two bundt cakes so i ll try flavoring the filling with some crushed fruit or jam and use it in a yellow or white cake,519
149110,2001689430,5,followed but brushed bottom and sides of pan with butter and heated it in the oven for 3 minutes before putting in batter came out perfect kids loved it and i was happy to be able to just cut pieces from this pancake cake instead of flipping on the stove,254
224374,280979,5,i haven t this yet but plan on making it soon i have friends from rochester and this is all i heard about i finally had a chance to visit rochester and experience the garbage plate for myself boy it was so ugly i was afraid to even try it i finally got up the nerve to try it and wow it was i almost finished the whole thing i will update the review once i it and get the reviews from my rochester natives,405
170111,1599348,5,when in a hurry i just boil the sweet potatoes in the chicken broth mash them with a potato masher and use canned tomatoes i leave out the coconut milk as i do not like coconut i also use crunchy peanut butter i dice the onions between the hand mashed potatoes the crunchy peanut butter and diced onions the soup has a texture which my family prefers over a totally smooth soup adjust the cayenne to taste,405
128564,441695,5,my husband loved this so much i had to it two weeks in a row he especially liked the marinade on shrimp which we then grilled together with the salmon i pureed the entire can of chiles and used a tablespoon of it mixed with 1 4 c mayo 1 4 c plain yogurt for dipping the shimp,275
25365,274866,4,quick and way to makeshift some gravy when the cupboards are bare used beef boulion and did add the extra beef concentrate browning liquid was with the meatloaf and mashed taters we had for supper for the,204
89204,288351,5,this is so and i have probably given this to 50 people who have raved about it you,82
21512,173674,5,i have this same and we absolutely love it i love to serve it in custard dishes with some berries on the side my husband puts a dollop of whipped cream on his it s wonderfully and truly decadent we ate this for a midnight snack on the night of christmas,253
16260,447742,5,my husband has asked me many times to mix up batch of this when he needs a dish to take to a potluck at work it s quick and everybody eats it up,144
26257,72483,4,the spice rub on this pork is excellent the pork is succulent and tender the sauce is not bad but i like my bbq sauce sweet spicy and smoky the sweetness was pretty dead on the money i added about 2 tbsp brown sugar i added about 2 tbsp black pepper 1 tbsp ground coriander a pinch of cayenne and about 2 tbsp of liquid smoke i also rubbed liquid smoke into the meat before cooking when i this again and believe me i will i will probably substitute dark brown sugar for the turbinado i guess the brown sugar is sweeter and smaller grained so it works into the meat more but that is me i have a sweet tooth you for such a heavenly,629
225582,1561184,5,i love pace and this is very also i had no jalapeno juice on hand so i used the white vinegar it turned out having too much of a vinegar taste for my liking next time i ll use the 1 4 cup jalapeno juice instead and i think all will be well for the,247
123809,2176785,5,i these for my daughter s preschool class and they were a huge hit based on reviews i decreased the blueberries to 1 3 4 cup i them as mini muffins and the 48 mini muffins which i baked for 28 minutes fantastic,210
68264,95262,4,this a dinner and had an attractive presentation but it needed a little garlic perhaps i will try it again,106
162516,353205,5,wonderful i can see why it is a family favorite i brought this to a church pot luck and it was the first item to disappear my husband later asked me why i brought something so instead of keeping it at home i have an idea to try the same thing with breakfast sausage and without the mozzerealla but serve with milk gravy on top of it wonderful well written directions to you and to your mom for sharing this this will become a regular for us,440
17598,1060806,5,wonderful my husband raved about this chicken and he never raves then he ate it as leftovers he hates leftover chicken and then he asked when we were going to have it again deserves more than five stars,202
92701,87870,5,wow i read this and went right into the kitchen to try it excellent i don t think i sliced mine thin enough though because only the outer sides got crispy but they were sort of tasted a little like home fries but that s fine with me,232
69622,119445,5,this is a wonderfully salad and a light treat after so many heavy holiday meals i did add some crispy crumbled bacon just to it a more complete lunch tip charolette to wash and hull the berries right before using strawberries should only be washed when ready to use to prolong their freshness,292
14911,1755,4,this was it was also very to for somebody that can t ever seem to get the lumps out,83
28768,1311294,5,followed the perfectly except only used 1 can of whole tomatoes just as families preference and it was so cheesy for the post,125
5092,153982,5,this is absolutely wonderful to as a variation for broccoli recipes it s so to flavor and i did use low fat low salt mushroom soup it came out and my mother n law a diabetic dying of lung ca really likes it i it for her every other week now you so much,252
133308,1634838,5,loved these so much i have already them twice this week they are so moreish i mine with half coley and half mackeral the combination of the two fish really adds to the taste i served mine with horseradish or garlic mayo and rocket salad heaven,243
81602,121008,5,this has become one of our families favorite dishes it is so fast and to after i cook the chicken i just add prego to the pan and melt the cheese in the oven,157
95988,66246,5,these wraps are sensational i love the cream cheese basil and garlic combination instead of ham and salami i used some left over 174041 i didn t have any fresh basil on hand so i used dry loads of flavor in this wrap just the way we like them lori for a that we will be making on a regular basis,295
2496,358015,5,this was perfect created it for an apple laptop cake for the first time i now use it for any time i want chocolate cake we don t use vegtable oil in our house but sunflower oil works perfectly still i use fine italian 00 flour and the finest bourban vanilla extract and always the best cocoa i can find really improves in the flavour for posting,345
6729,1441866,5,wow this bread is light moist bread with beautiful cheddar stripes when you cut it open the whole family loved it and we finished it within hours of it coming out of the oven no problem rising but i had it in a warm place covered with plastic also pay close attention to the yeast measured in tblsp when typically it is measured in tsp this is one of my favorite breads of all time and i bake a lot of bread i folded the cheddar in without much action so there were veins of cheddar throughout instead of just shreds all over it was wonderful better than my favorite three cheese panera bread takes more than the 15 min prep time mentioned,639
51721,2002143289,4,salad is lovely this is all the stuff i put in cold beet borsch i just dumped a large spoonful into a bowl of cold borsch delish,128
207043,2000800786,5,i tried the receipe several times it worked perfectly every time the aroma the texture of spices and most importantly the taste is fabulous,139
117108,515141,5,just the right taste i finally found the perfect dressing i have been craving,77
420398,2000907255,5,you soooo much i have been wondering how to these for a really long time it was a little tricky at first but i 039 m really starting to get the hang of it,154
39618,156001,5,this was the crispiest juiciest fried chicken i ve ever and the seasonings were perfect you for a i will definately be making this again,136
42679,441188,5,these are very cookies it should be noted that the scovil baker makes these with sorghum and they don t taste the same with molasses because molasses has a stronger flavor also be sure not to add too much flour or they will be too bready hopefully i m the only novice cook to that mistake,288
205602,541652,5,this is one of our all time summer favorites whenever we take it to back yard gatherings it is the first to disappear on a hot summer day,137
178204,705024,5,i m not usually a huge fish fan but i try to eat it for health reasons this was the best fish i ve ever the tomato and basil really seam to cover up the fish flavor which is a thing in my mind i it just like the says and found it quite flavorful i will definitely this again,274
3153,105471,5,i did mine in the saucepan and i was glad i did because the caramel cooled quickly and i thought it would be hard to get all the apples coated the way you want and onto the wax paper unless you kept the caramel heated anyway they were and i served them at my daughter s birthday party and the kids liked them better than cake,325
24308,1622219,5,this cake was wonderful just as i remembered it growing up so it didn t last long at our house planning to another one tonight for breakfast tomorrow for bringing this long time favorite back,191
40738,135002,4,tasted just like what i had at the 4 seasons in chicago i omitted the liquor i was all out and used a combination of pumpkin pie spice and nutmeg 1 tsp pie spice 1 4 tsp nutmeg i won t serve pumpkin pie any more this was so much better,235
487364,2002205928,5,this was the best steak i ve ever had omg i followed the except i used 1 3 the salt you,87
57679,18660,5,a very key lime pie with texture i used a shortbread crust to i live in florida and this is my favorite by far,110
480861,2902647,5,i loved this and so did my coworkers i the cake and the filling the night before and baked it the next day it turned out fabulous i will this again,147
129342,741657,5,i loved how this is it tasted like a different variation of chili serves a big family,85
138541,316809,5,i this for pac 2012 this was really with crackers but it was even better when added to a turkey sandwich with sourdough bread i will this again for sure for a,158
25625,552227,5,you ve given me a reason to eat peanut butter again,51
26135,1295837,4,substituted capers for onions it was a very recipie alot,56
17073,1189155,4,this was absolutely and tasted exactly like the sauce at the restaurant we love the grill glaze at tgi s however i did have some trouble getting it thicker than say warm maple syrup i added more onions and pineapple since it just didnt look like it had enough in it and left out the jack was and will definately everytime i bbq from now on,339
375991,1488718,5,i am from nacogdoches tx and this comes very close to the actual restaurants the restuarant uses powder and such so unles you can order exactly what they use it wont be the exact but again fantastic and comes very close,219
245447,606427,5,i was about to give up on brown rice i ve tried to it twice and i never cooked it long enough or i had lots of liquid and still crunchy grains this was perfect it the whole house smell i didn t have a bay leaf and used vegeta for my seasoning salt using only 1 tsp as vegeta can be rather salty the rice was is so,313
16570,453209,2,i ve other asian type sauces on my own and they had much more flavor than this one sorry it was just too bland for me although my young kids liked it the sauce didn t thicken up enough either and i had the exact balance of cornstarch to liquid as in the,253
35813,1803570346,1,i am sorry but i do not enjoy the general enthusiasm for this i tried a couple of samples and they were very harsh and dry and also the texture was falling apart they had poor general surface appearance i decided to add 1 1 2 cups of milk and try again it produced a remarkable change in texture appearance and edibility if i were to do it again i think i would try replacing the milk with the same amount of high quality orange juice to add some additional flavour but there is no doubt in my mind that this needs the addition of some liquid to produce a desirable result,572
66596,933958,5,add my 5 stars to the other 230 kittencal i have not fixed any of your recipes that were nt worthy of 5 stars keep it up thanx,126
134691,232270,5,this was a it didn t turn out spicy for me either not that it matters because i do love spicy it was just right i loved it for posting it,137
104595,233801,5,i thought the combination of flavors was i did end up using equal parts onion zucchini sliced long and thin and the same amount of red green yellow peppers including one hot red pepper sliced thin and used pinto instead of kidney beans my favorite bean because it turns so creamy and when you mix it around with the veggies the sweet flavors of the peppers beans really went well with the spices i also used whole grain tortillas toasted lightly on each side in vegetable oil for a fast,486
316100,2001297534,5,other than adjusting the to two servings i this as written i also took the suggestion of other reviewers and served it on a bed of spaghetti the meal was to put together and i will definitely this again for sharing,214
341249,744898,5,we cut the in half to 5 lbs instead of putting them in the casings i rolled them in the shape of a large link sausage and flash froze them then froze them together in a lg ziploc baggie i look forward to using them in some jambalaya i plan to soon the flavor of the sausage is wonderful and it really isn t hard to and goes pretty quickly once you get everything together we will enjoy these many times to come,410
209447,300920,5,wow this is very similar to our family s too i always knew the ingredients but was never sure about the proportions the scent is really to die for for sharing,158
108778,105125,4,i don t like jello or vanilla ice cream but i had to this it was so light and flavorful my kids loved it it was even better the 2nd day i can t wait to try the all berry one for sharing this,190
29006,627647,4,my family absolutely loved this soup i did change a few things added some celery and some boullion i used chicken breasts on the bone and used only 2 3 of the dough for the noodles it yeilded the perfect amount overall we loved it,230
107774,192249,3,i just finished making these and i followed the exactly they are very cakey in fact i would classify them as cake bars instead of cookie bars i planned on giving them away as a gift but they are falling apart like cake tastes but i have a feeling i will be putting ice cream on top and eating them that way,306
107267,255665,4,very i added a little bit more water and used an orange bell pepper instead of green i just don t care for the green ones i definately would this again,151
76930,112880,4,very i worked until late so i pre measured all the ingredients and combined just before cooking the whole thing was done in 20 minutes i did serve the noodles hot due to this but they were very my boyfriend hated the smell of the sesame oil though he s still talking about how bad it smelled you know how men can be sometimes anyway for a,338
41703,104309,5,fabulous was tempted to cover it as it baked because i thought it would be dry i followed the directions as written and will this again and again,145
124129,91962,5,this today just for fun fantastic i will be making this at our next get together we are a family of chocoholics and i am sure this will be a big hit,148
87085,131807,5,i know there are already a lot of reviews but i just had to add mine also this is such a wonderful and so quick and i did add extra cheese on top i know this won t last long in my house so will plan to it often for posting it is a definite must try,248
167298,339025,5,this is a very when you want fried chicken quick you can pretty much find all of the ingredients in your pantry without having to go shopping find,146
8701,689367,5,we like the hot sweet more than sweet hot so i subbed 2 t creole rub from steven raichlens barbecue bible for the dry spices used 3 4 c of honey and no sugars i did use the old bay seasoning and the 1 4 c vinegar suggested by some reviewers slow cooker not recommended,268
90242,147739,5,i tried this after my sister if for me and loved it i don t have the savory so i left it out and i didn t have the bouillon so i used chicken broth instead of water and my whole family loved it the first time i it i was afraid of burning the rice the second time i let it brown way more and it was even better,309
192332,594793,5,this dish was to put together and was i followed the directions except cooked it on the stove medium low heat for 1 hour and 15 minutes perfect so much for sharing this i will definitely be making it again,205
12939,1504099,4,i didn t have the time to use the water method but the cornmeal works also added some cajun spices to the cornmeal and salt mmmm southern it s best,147
57535,221351,5,i these the other day and everyone loved them it s very to bake as vegan muffins by using soy milk texutre flavour and very many,128
84738,1498087,5,i changed it a little because i had an extra little while i used my bbq grill and cooked fresh corn on the cob and the bell peppers until they were slightly blackened i then rapidly cooled them on ice and cut the corn off the cob and cut the peppers up i used four cobs of corn roasted on bbq two cucumbers two fresh tomatoes seeded and cut 1 bunch cilantro diced 1 and a half teaspoons crushed cumin one green and two red bell peppers roasted on the bbq and diced two tablespoons vinegar one and a half tablespoons of crushed fresh garlic next time i will try to roast a few cloves instead of buying a jar of crushed garlic and one teaspoon red pepper flakes you may want to cut that to 3 4 serve with some meat bbqed something sweet like corn bread and butter with a watermelon as desert we had four adults three teen agers and three kids it was a huge hit and there were leftovers that everyone wanted to save,912
129,1398976,5,delicoius this with a sparkling blush and it was wonderful a big hit at our party,81
749,462637,5,divine outstanding what i like the most my 17 month old daughter loved it i adapted it to what we like and don t i e no cottage cheese i also added chuncks of zucchini to the meat along with mushrooms definitively a keeper,222
111315,1864342,5,for a potluck or barbeque can t do better my favorite cole slaw luby s generally does excellet cafeteria and this is one of their best dozens of people have asked for the and it really can be prepared a day ahead my wife who usually does not like cole slaw loves this one quick to with a processor slicer,304
113256,215951,5,this was wonderful i ve it several times both with salsa and with the tomato mix yum i also only needed two tortillas i d it tonight if i had all the stuff,155
38065,286903,2,this doesn t really taste like a breakfast it tastes more like stuffing than anything we ended up throwing most of it out,121
307445,380466,5,wow this was so to put together we tried it with lemonade i m interested to try it with the smirnoff since i love those we really enjoyed this for posting for pac fall 08,170
356535,2001895207,5,a delish way to use leftover smoked turkey i used avocado mayo and cut the amount by 1 2 while increasing the dijon x2 also added chopped carrots and fennel it s fantastic,171
42310,57397,5,this is just too delish to explain such a quick meal but wonderful flavours it is as as what you would get at a real fancy fancy restaurant being a real garlic freak instead of just 7 cloves of garlic i used 2 heads of garlic and sauteed it with one big white onion and it was just wonderful how we like it at home i didn t have any hot chilli peppers so i used quite a few generous dashes of paprika powder to up for the heat it worked fine also to it for myself after cooking the garlic and onion i just threw in my raw clams still in the shell with 1 cup of white wine and half a small bottle of clam juice this is just wonderful i do realise that i have quite a few changes but it was just that i got a bit carried away with the wonderful aroma of everything and i used angel hair for the pasta try this mean chef you you you,829
96790,724218,4,this was and refreshing you for sharing,39
117211,602395,4,this turned out very well i used quick oats and only let it set 2 3 hours and it still turned out very well i will definitely try it again,138
39087,1458822,5,love this i mix the parmesan cheese in with the dish rather than sprinkle it on top,83
113746,145666,5,this was outstanding we also didn t use the marshmallows very to put together and just beautiful color when finished you for posting looking forward to making again for christmas dinner,185
270951,169130,4,salt was mentioned in the text but not listed in the ingredient list so i wasn t sure how much to add i am not a baker so i guessed at 1 2 tsp my daughter thought it was pretty messy to roll them into balls but she thought they tasted like the donut shop munchkins since i said they were cookies she renamed them munkies these were the only christmas cookies we this year and they turned out well took 15 mins to bake ours,422
94595,200728,4,i prefer to enhance the flavour by adding extra soya sauce vinegar garlic ginger and sesame oil i also added some sugar to it a bit sweet,137
54266,135456,5,i was going to post my on this site when i came across this one it s very close to mine only difference is that i use a pound of bacon and a pound of sausage not as much chicken broth more milk more butter and i only add about 1 4 cup of grease from the bacon and sausage pan what i call the leavin s all the crumbs and whatnot that are left after pouring out most of the grease i haven t tried it with carrots but i ll bet that s too i don t add the cheese like this i use shredded cheddar and top the soup with it after ladeling into serving dishes salt and pepper to taste this stuff may be high in cholesteral but no one cares once they taste it haha i get loads of requests to this very,691
79563,305147,5,wow i love split pea soup but this is just the best with some minor tweaks i used only ten cups of liquid half water half chicken stock and it was still a little bit much also i used just a pinch of salt since the stock had some my husband just finished his third bowl and can t stop raving about it and i thought my previous was pretty this is i am going to go out tomorrow and buy more of everything to another huge pot to freeze for the winter updated our first pot for this winter i ve found over the last winter and many pots that 3 rounded cups of split peas the perfect thickness for us and we add three crushed garlic cloves i can t wait for my first bowl of the season ok technically it s still summer but there s a hint of autumn in the air here,755
113210,520830,5,i have this many times and it is wonderful i grew up in calif where walnuts were plentiful and fresh i saw this in a 1983 mccall s magazine cooking school page has a presentation and tastes too,193
31163,125109,5,d lish i actually used fresh green beans covered them with water as suggested and let them cook the sweetness of the onions and the flavor of the bacon gave it a sweet salty balance served with roasted chicken and rosted potatoes for dinner tonight for this keeper,264
13285,1053283,5,these burgers are really they are full of mediterranean flavors so if you are a fan of greek you will probably like these a lot i some tzatziki to top them the is and can be found on com and put them on a thin pita like bun with lettuce tomato and red onion i bought a few olives from the deli bar at my local grocery store since it was less expensive than getting an entire jar i will definitely these again,408
83185,111347,5,this was excellent being on a low carb diet this was so flavorful and i almost forgot how much i miss starchy sides i used two pounds of ground beef and i cooked it in a casserole dish but other than that it is perfect just the way it is written you for sharing,261
162532,815291,5,you should tell people to use a small to medium size egg i just used a jumbo egg and it was messy tasted but was really messy,125
52892,599261,5,love it tasted parmesan cheese took a while to mix in and melt but yumm yumm,76
92803,128723,5,you so much for posting this i love the fact that i can control what goes in this sauce and the taste is didn t have sherry so i left it out and added probably 1 4 1 2 cup sugar as another reviewer did and also used fresh ginger i this on the stove top and it takes no time at all i would never buy bottled after tasting this you so much i will be making this often,365
349246,2002314365,4,it turned out pretty i added chocolate chips before microwaving and caramel syrup with a sprinkle of salt on top after microwaving and it s not too shabby it ll definitely do in a pinch when you don t have any milk or eggs for a regular cake brownie my husband gobbled it up,274
12656,1559224,5,this for a dinner party and it was a hit the only change i was to add fresh asparagus cut in 1 lengths to the shrimp mixture this was my first attempt at making crepes and it was much easier than i expected for a,212
9347,61886,5,this was really on my bread pudding i liked it with vanilla too,63
415179,1540903,5,deliciously flavored i tried it w egg noodles and luv d it but next time i will try it w rice,93
459749,1788556,3,i must be doing something wrong because every time i this three times already it is just so bland tasting it smells texture and tastes okay but it hasn t much taste to me everyone keeps saying that this is the best mac and cheese in the world so it has to be me maybe the got lost in converting from cups to gram i don t know too bad,333
138297,342524,4,all in all it s a the kids liked it and there weren t any left i this as directed and think that the next time i try it i will a few small changes first i will use either cooking spray a lot less butter or nothing instead of 1 tbsp butter for browning the quesadillas i like butter but with the sour cream it was too much and it taste a little heavy second i think i will cut down the amount of sour cream again too heavy and maybe i just like my stuff a tinch sweeter but i will double the cinnamon and sugar for each as well,526
139664,492789,5,wonderfull i don t like venison and i got it down i will it again,65
11743,63146,5,very to and they are so next time i ll add some sliced mushrooms as my oldest ds say it s a keeper sheila for posting this,122
474549,168771,5,superb dish veal was on sale i used a mixture of cuts as shanks were not available i browned the meat so well and the cuts were tender enough that the dish was done in about 3 hours on low all veggies had been partially cooked at the beginning also we served over brown rice with the gremelata and it was a hit with the family,326
10084,166711,5,this is listed in my family cookbook as president eisenhower s favorite strawberry pie a former boyfriend loved it and often asked me to it for him it s to and definitely a winner i d like to add that my calls for 1 and a half quarts of fresh strawberries half the looking ones are reserved and the rest are mashed the mashed strawberries are cooked with the sugar and cornstarch once thickened and clear one tablespoon of lemon juice can be added if desired after the mixture has cooled i add the remaining whole berries,521
40272,140028,5,loved it everything s better with bacon,39
146393,230157,3,this is for adding flavor to western cooking however authentic happens also to be very palatable i used this for bbq chicken marinated and glazed with a bit in the oven and and it was slightly overpowering i think i d cut back next time on the world tour of spices and limit to 3 for my tastes,293
153390,287364,4,very i didn t follow exactly as i used 1 lb white american processed cheese cubes with peppers from the regular cheese section at the store combined with 1 cup milk skim next time i ll use whole in double boiler we liked this dip a lot but if i use this same cheese next time i ll add some jalepeno peppers and a little juice as called for or i ll it exactly as this is written for a dip,387
272931,247780,5,just these and the filling is so i had sausage stuffing roast potatoes i didn t have any left over veg so i used a can of mixed veg swede parsnip turnip carrot and i used the left over gravy i used a cereal bowl to cut out the circle and 4 sized pasties with a normal pack of pre rolled shortcrust pastry i did have quite a bit of filling left as maybe i should have had more pastry but i bet the filling will freeze brilliantly for another super quick meal defrost the filling throw in the pastry and impress the family for a idea on how to get rid of my leftovers,565
117211,784784,5,this was wonderful beware you ll never want a bowl of plain oatmeal again,73
189528,346496,5,this was an excellent meal with the chicken served over rice i would however bigger portions for 4 people two of us ate this as is tasted wonderful with diane sauce for the hot sauce that it says sheryl,202
290219,2170326,4,this was very and,17
345941,172079,5,i give this 5 stars but with an important note i think it s a poor idea to drink this full amount in full strength for one thing the sodium level is way too high it might be better to this up and then add a tablespoon to a cup of water to drink several times throughout the day the exception might be to take a few swallows full strength to soothe a very sore throat but again it s very important to avoid dehydration especially when ill and persons with high blood pressure might want to check with their doctor before taking anything with this much salt in it,561
28091,931049,5,these bars are so they were super moist and had a wonderful banana flavor added chocolate chips to the bottom and a pinch of nutmeg also,136
28377,773408,4,thought this was excellent basically we doubled the and used 16 oz of noodles as was our dinner for the evening fed 6 added fresh squeezed lime at serving,154
43509,1015359,5,my whole family loved them,26
9326,2471670,5,my family loved this i used whole white wheat flour instead of white also used semi sweet chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate,131
297919,48365,5,real did not use blender just wisked very well used evaporated milk worked,74
52349,1287015,5,adapted it a bit used croissants cocoa and mashed bananas i 4 times the for a family dinner,91
89204,1117905,5,my kids don t like crock pot meals much but this has the thumbs up from everyone and it is so to throw together with things you have anyway or adapt with other veggies and spices for sharing,190
35411,47230,5,my daughter and i love pumpkin soup this was so and actually very to and creamy the curry mushrooms and nutmeg give it that extra special touch i put some in the freezer for future use nurse di,193
141653,156352,5,wow these pork chops were the sauce was was so will this again soon,67
48532,240410,2,so i had some big hopes for these cookies but am i the only one that s experienced them not sticking together they re crumbly messes i wouldn t them again as i found them just too sweet,185
43100,632046,5,this was wonderful and so to it was a big hit with my husband and our dinner guests i a no bake graham cracker crust to go with this instead of using a regular pie shell and it was a hit our friend said he normally wouldn t eat the shell with a pudding type pie but that this crust was perfect will definately this again,320
109211,1601538,5,i mixed the lemon pepper into the patty rather than sprinkling we cut the patties into chunks and placed into corn tortillas with a little tartar sauce and spinach leaves for some fish tacos for this one,203
199579,1800238966,5,i 039 ve tried tuna casserole recipes where they turn out somewhat dry and nothing to remember this was sooo so creamy and it exactly as the directed for user okra who felt they needed to research 6 oz cooked pasta it means 6 oz of dry pasta cooked the only thing i added was a light sprinkling of cheddar cheese and mozzarella on top my boyfriend was amazed from the very first bite and i was too will definitely be making this again this it into the book of the best recipes in our kitchen you,495
23657,248602,5,this was just i added sliced olives and ate some feta cheese with it,68
176071,963934,5,please explain to me how someone can review a that they ve changed completely from the original the main flavor in this comes from the firey green thai paste and the perfect tender crisp vegetables come from the microwave cooking method i tend to 5 star recipes as tried and true but i m so glad i gave this one a chance because it s outstanding as written a reminder to all of us who rate judge the not your adaptation,419
84253,207478,5,dh and i loved this so much he finished up leftovers the next morning between yums he suggested we try it with squid also sounds like a idea it s that versatile,160
219728,1216549,2,this is ok i felt like something was missing there were all these wonderful and aromatic spices yet the dish lacked depth also i think it could use just a titch less curry i could actually feel the powdery texture of the curry i do not think i will this again as written,270
60385,632052,5,very it really is important to chill the dough and grate it in the pan it really does help develop the texture of the crust and topping since this makes a large pan i halved the and baked it in an 8x8 pan for hubby and i if you love shortbread you will love these bars i also like to stir in a few tablespoons of strawberry jam to my rhubarb mixture to a strawberry rhubarb bar,377
8696,237053,4,i worked for the lobster hpuse in cape may n j a lifetime ago i the crab cakes amd your comes sooooooo close i added parsley a little garlic and onion powder and diced some green pepper i also diced about three slices of soft bread crust removed to give the cakes a lighter texture so leslie i almost forgot just how crab cakes were,332
80156,1024982,5,fabulous flavour and texture i too added 1 2 tsp ground nutmeg eight minutes in the oven at 180 degrees c was just perfect for the thicker ones almost half an inch thick you update used 1 2 cup white sugar with 1 2 cup molasses as it s hard to find brown sugar here sweet enough i can t stop eating them dunking them briefly in hot tea or coffee is brilliant as well these again this time with a few cookies sprinkled with poppyseed lovely 3 cups flour is actually slightly too much,482
127838,37598,5,stacky the sounds and the franks in the photo look can you tell me the brand name,81
82925,376899,5,fantastic we love the crunchy top so i double the crust ingredients you for the i have the crisp a couple of times already and will many more times,147
88693,137050,5,this was a tasting and to fix something i will definately do again the only thing i did different was to put the jalapeno in a small plastic bag after charring it this steamed the pepper and it easier for the skin to fall off,225
92382,1073031,5,this cookie tastes as as anything i ve bought in the best italian bakeries it was to and wonderful in every way,111
28548,39547,5,we had this last night and it was an excellent thai curry it seemed to take a long time to with a lot of small steps so i m thinking that i d like to come up with a simpler using similar ingredients that will taste basically the same also instead of cucumber we used moqua also known as chinese fuzzy squash because that s what this would have originally called for it was our first time cooking with the unusual asian vegetable and we were quite pleased with the results the texture was nicer than cucumber and the taste was quice as well info on the moqua can be found here http www 1webblvd com coosemans prod143 htm,619
82486,2225219,4,this is a i some changes too i cut the sugar down added 1 2 cup brown sugar and 1 2 cup white sugar for one cup total believe me thats all this needs i didn t have buttermilk so i used a tbsp of vanilla yogurt thinned down with milk to total 1 4 cup my family doesn t like nuts so i added 1 2 cup of mini chocolate chips i this into muffins the makes exactly 12 large muffins as i it and i a mixture of brown and white sugar with a little cinnamon and sprinkled it on top before baking these muffins bake at 375 until done and then hide them so they have time to cool to all who offered suggestions don t you just love a basic that you can play with and your own and something really delish,690
24638,1553025,5,the five stars are strictly for the tomato paste and red wine vinegar this combination is a winner build the remainder as loosely as you choose i would suggest that rather than add the tomato paste with the barley you a well in the veggies during saute and caramelize for added depth and sweetness you lennie,308
24687,11436,5,i thought this was and you can use you anything you have on hand i added mushrooms i didn t have water chestnuts so i used celery and it was fine the sauce is very and complements the pancake well,196
65547,138174,4,i had a chance to do a taste comparison between my 103201 troy hakala s 5365 the spices this a substitute for pumpkin pie but the cake was not as light and fluffy as the other recipes using baking soda instead of baking powder,226
38806,447893,5,i used mexican 4 cheese blend added a bit of tabasco sauce and it turned out a big hit with all the adults and kids for a,121
32317,49652,5,i this for a birthday party and then for a barbeque and everyone loved it the salad has a wonderful crunch to it and the dressing is when you this be prepared to be asked for the,178
30081,2001101233,3,the sugar in the sauce is absolutely unnecessary but you must add a little salt lemon zest 1 1 2 tbsp of the juice as well as dill or mint to it authentic tzatziki otherwise as written it s blah bland oh amp sure you drain your cucs if you aren t using the sauce immediately bc it will get very watery runny if you don t in terms of the meat if you want a real gyro texture look add a half a cup of oatmeal amp knead for a couple of minutes not 10 minutes as others suggested no need to beat anything on the counter either giggling at that one bc i can t imagine 20 minutes kneading amp beating ground meat the oats will do the work for you trust me try adding some allspice parsley amp cumin to the meat mixture they are additions again making it more traditional,764
155240,1033807,5,this was an first of all it was second of all it my house smell like a bakery and third of all we lived in germany and these taste like authentic brotchens my family loved them and i can t wait to them again,207
170147,893474,5,and decadent i followed the directions to the letter and the result was perfection btw this yielded almost a quart rather than a pint,133
80306,1971199,5,this is it was gone in 15 minutes i added 1 4 cup cream cheese to it creamier i served it with wedges of toast and whole grain crackers so to too,145
163781,2273238,5,i this soup for passover and everyone loved it my husband told the guest that this was probably similar to the soup that jacob and esau sold his birthright over one of the people there said i can see why will be making again very soon i couldn t find any fennel and i didn t put red onion in it,294
196435,609895,5,to this into a dairy free stroganoff i easily substituted soy milk to accommodate my son s dairy allergy and the flavor was still my entire family loved this seconds for everyone,178
298950,114995,5,you for posting this it is i can purchase this salad at one of our local grocery stores but it is a bit pricey i m looking forward to making this in my own kitchen for a fraction of the cost,190
52491,372732,5,this was so everyone enjoyed it,31
21303,468204,4,really to cook really to eat will definitely cook again i thought about adding nutmeg but it didn t need anything added honestly,128
276681,1120293,5,these are by far the very best cinnamon rolls i have ever tasted the croissant dough makes these crisp on the outside and so soft on the inside these do take a few days but they are completely worth it here a few suggestions 1 when you refrigerate the dough for the second time in a plastic bag you should use 2 bags so the dough doesn t spill out 2 use only a very small amount of the egg and water mixture or otherwise it will start to bubble and spill over the pans 3 i don t have any large muffin tins so i just them on a baking sheet this actually works a lot better than trying to use regular muffin tins 4 you don t need to roll these in white sugar when they re done they are already sweet enough however if you want them a little sweeter you can sprinkle some cinnamon sugar on them these are totally irresistible,822
86067,756031,5,fresh picked juicy cherry tomatoes and dressing to round it all off i added some fresh garlic and a small splash of balsamic vinegar outstanding and reviewed for nz aus swap 31 aug 2009,185
122412,506688,5,it was so to and so quick we loved it,37
161071,444534,4,i this after seeing it printed in kraft foods magazine because i am searching for a really cream filled cupcake they were tasted and went fast at the picnic as another reviewer mentioned when i used a 1 4 cup of batter on the bottom i ran out of batter to cover the filling i have to admit that i thought these would taste a little more exciting if you didn t know there was a filling with a oreo in the middle and your eyes were closed you would guess it was just a basic chocolate cupcake i started to top the cupcakes with the whipped cream however due to the heat whipped topping melting all over i had to scrape the whipped topping for a traditional frosting my family really enjoyed this treat i was a little less impressed i will probably try making them again because they were but i am still looking for a better filled cupcake,836
17883,71463,5,quick and to whip up wonderful i kicked up the seasoning a notch or two threw in a jalapeno agree with other reviewers the balance of meat and beans is perfect thanx for a keeper froze some for later also,204
33914,43006,5,i ve this and it is i have also added a can of chilies on top of the hormel chili it disapears quickly,102
29785,176843,3,i followed the directions exactly and pulled them from the oven an hour early and they were all dried out and inedible the flavor was and i could tell they would have been but they just were overdone not sure what i did wrong but i will try again,246
148233,275742,4,this was pretty for sharing this,32
9737,36810,5,my family is tired of the same old menus eating in or out so i found zaar this was the first dish i it was wonderful my husband and i loved it definitely will again,164
413638,62086,5,stuffed baked potatoes are one of my favorite things to and eat and these were no exception fabulous when i picked this to try i didn t think it would be that special but i was wrong the flavors are perfect and you can really taste the smoky paprika but it s not overpowering and that s a thing i ve also never thought to add green onion to these and in future twice baked potato recipes i will i loved them the only thing i did differently was really work my potatoes i like them very smooth no lumps so i mashed first with the butter then add one dairy ingredient at a time and keep mashing which is how i always my stuffed potatoes and mashed potatoes i the full and they stayed well in the fridge for 3 nights of side dishes of all the recipes i tested for this contest this is the standout favorite for me these were really outstanding and i wish you the best of luck in the contest entry,893
69013,292160,5,i have tried this cornbread and my family can t get enough of it i have to it for them at least once a month it is very to just sure the broccoli is well drained,161
46461,2001343758,5,this was so i used 3 cans of rotel tomatoes just bc i love tomatoes i also added in mushrooms i will definitely this again,122
80941,687917,5,i ve this twice now in my rice cooker and it s been a hit both times i think it s a mix of flavors but yet not too overpowering i have not added sugar or the lime leaf on either occasions i really didn t think the sugar was necessary for sharing,245
145419,343484,5,i got this from a cookbook at home and it was really i brought it to a blockparty and there was none left to take home it was a hit,131
515167,1802649786,5,i just love it,14
381622,617558,5,hey these should be retitled omg mah peanut buttah cookehs got all growed up because they are just that and should be treated as and respected as such peanut butter cookies all grown up yum do not manhandle these and hand form they will fall apart when you transfer to a wire rack to cool just a tip,299
58518,312338,4,this tasted but the sauce was very herby meaning that the herbs clumped together alot and also got stuck in our teeth lol but if you re home with your loved one who doesn t mind helping you pick things out of your teeth it s a weeknight meal,241
91302,448206,5,i used this for a final exam in my commercial cooking class we had to cook a meal for our teachers and i chose this as the main course it was and i paased with flying colours,174
116119,2002028738,4,when everyone in the house loves these besides the person who is always on a diet ehemm you know they re i too the same adjustments by cutting down the sugar to 1 1 2 cups and adding some chocolate chips which i think is a must and makes it taste more like an actual brownie it has a very moist texture like most brownies with a slight cake like consistency to it easier to grab quickly i bake them in a cupcake pan and they come out perfect this way you can get an exact calorie count as well if need be i gave it 4 stars because i think the should call for chocolate chips and doesn t add that much more fat to the who doesn t love a smidge more chocolate,657
193085,2000052051,2,i this and followed the exactly but for some reason while it was baking all the corn oil bubbled to the top of the pan and then it started boiling over so every 20 minutes or so throughout the baking process i had to drain the boiling oil from the top of the cake i have no idea what i did wrong but i think my dog liked it so i guess it working out except for the boiling oil,376
40207,181781,5,excellent dish i this and have posted a new that includes measurements of some ingredients that are missing above trying to take the guess work out of it see 124203,164
73061,1194107,5,these rose beautifully the muffins looked and smelled fantastic coming out of the oven they are very fresh and remain and moist the next day i popped them in the freezer and they warm up,186
323172,868298,1,this was awful the v8 juice over powers the taste,49
39509,1290337,5,im so excited these turned out so now to attempt the tiramisu,61
349246,2001447949,5,i never new brownies could be this amp yum,42
21726,2002051964,5,turned out we spent a year in oz and the pie was very authentic tasting used the cubed beef and veg broth tweaks as well as homemade whole wheat crust tasted fair dinkum,169
242916,350627,4,a very carrot salad we enjoyed the smoky flavour of the mustard seeds and the hint of spice from the chili complimented but did not over power we added just a touch of rice vinegar as we found there was not quite enough acid from the lemon next time we this we will add a little extra of the toasted mustard seeds very much for this salad,338
232311,378965,5,this is my new favorite dressing so and low fat when i this a second time i let the veggies marinate in the dressing for an hour or so and then added them to the lettuce they absorbed the flavors and were fabulous,213
26110,114468,5,even though they were overcooked light airy and mixes up quickly,64
24317,337472,4,i these rolls for my family for breakfast this morning they were a big hit i did switch out the cup of very warm water with a cup of very warm milk instead to i am usually the first person up in our house so they had about two hours to rise in the muffin tins and bake before the kids woke up,292
271489,502504,5,this is outstanding i changed the water twice to sure the ham shoulder was not salty i added parsnips and turnip to list of vegetables the meat was so tender and not salty and the veggies were perfect so much for sharing,220
313521,741602,4,baked exactly as posted and it turned out everyone loved it,59
189523,1838847,2,yuck this muffins taste baking powdery maybe because i didn t cook it well because i put it in 395 f and i stirred in cinnamon in the last minute oh well,153
91010,42177,5,tasting and to do apart from using an egg cooker to prepare my eggs i stuck to the and added a little salt to the egg yolk mix i will certainly this again for the,162
30217,7422,5,wow i had never grilled shrimp before let alone cook raw shrimp i this for my son his girlfriend and the 3 of us practically ate it all followed exactly such a lovely different way to eat shrimp we served with roasted asparagus and baked potatoes the few leftovers were fought over the next day and just as,306
45287,1497741,5,these are you can t tell they are gluten free i used bob s red mill gf all purpose flour the texture and taste is just like a normal cookie i rolled the dough balls in sugar and put a hershey s kiss on the top when they came out of the oven soooo you for the,258
14125,822209,3,i liked the molten cranberry inside the cake when the cake was hot i have a dark pan so i set the oven at 325 and baked it for about 50 minutes but it still got a little too brown on the edges the flavor is but i m comparing it to another from the austin junior league s ropin in the flavor of texas which has one of my favorite cranberry cake recipes so i m giving this 3 stars,378
71203,1959026,5,first time doing pickles turned out excellent and everyone really like them update ok did my second batch but used the cider vinegar this time white last time and turned out again i used pint jars and came out with exactly 8 jars as i did the first time also the oven trick for sterilizing works perfect will definately use again and again,339
397523,880806,5,this was i followed the as written except i used two cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can golden mushroom soup my family inhaled it and the gravy from the crock pot was a definite keeper,225
31027,39329,4,this is a very moist cake and so to put together i cooked mine in a tube cake pan,81
56187,301449,5,this must be to to be true,26
74238,71567,5,this is a fabulous i have this using both green pesto and a sun dried tomato pesto alternating layers for a festive holiday appetizer,133
132238,868928,4,yummmm i didn t have any of these vegetables or the fresh thyme for that matter i used regular chopped carrot green beans shredded cabbage bok choy summer squash and cherry tomatoes for the fresh herb i used 2 sprigs of rosemary there wasn t any lemon either yet still my god what a treat even my finicky son liked it and it goes with just about anything,354
216179,98994,4,this is a really sauce but to me it tastes more like a teriyaki sauce than a bourbon sauce none the less it is a very sauce for posting,135
401819,1457707,5,tried it with the family and the orzo wasn t the biggest hit but the meatballs were gobbled up in a heartbeat would definitely recommend,136
107437,1672135,5,i purchased everything to this casserole but somehow the tortilla chips managed to magically get a rip and my chip loving family had to help them from a near certain staleness death to compensate i added 2 cans of whole kernel corn this was tasted like chili that had cooked for hours upon hours with only 30 mins in the oven will most def this again with the corn,364
487825,2814103,5,this was really and i had a bunch of strawberries i needed to use and i had everything else i needed on hand creamy and not overly sweet i will definitely this again,165
21239,552055,5,the family loved it i only used 2 ounces of regular cream cheese and add a little bit of milk i also topped with a mixture of colby jack cheese and italian bread crumbs what a hit will def be making over and over again,218
131018,845905,4,love this the only thing i do differently is i pour out all the leavings after shredding the meat we are not big onion fans here my family loves it and i can usually get two meals out of it i have a newer crock pot so i cook it on low for about 8 9 hours then shred then cook with sauce for another hour or so works,315
18410,230210,5,these cr pes are so wonderful i usually have to a double batch to keep up with the demand i like to substitute a teaspoon of butter melted for the oil i also find it easier to use two bowls one for the flour and one for the liquid ingredients this way you can pour in the liquid mixture into the flour gradually thusly eliminate lumps we use a mixture of sugar and lemon juice for our cr pes and they taste,406
83807,1135521,4,really i tried to these vegan by substituting vegan almesan cheese the breading didn t stick at all the flavor was but it was more like just crumbles on the plate with the zucchini which was disappointing that said i did the suggested horseradish dip and my vegephobe brother in law actually scarfed these down which really floored me my other guests also liked these a lot like other reviewers my texture was pretty mushy on some i tried broiling at first but just wound up burning the breadcrumbs i don t know whether the just doesn t want to be vegan or what but it s not a total homerun with me,598
115660,756769,5,mighty i followed the directions exactly and it was perfect,59
131477,57437,5,i these this past week and they were very a way to use up the zucchini in my garden i just sliced them so i had rounds and panfried extremely and i used seasoned bread crumbs and dipped them in ranch dressing i know these will be again,235
56604,33804,4,i this cake for a family holiday i was told it was but very rich next time i would use less coconut i felt it was alittle overpowering the chocolate icing on top was and thick which reminded me of the icing on top of an entermann s cake i would this again,255
271647,337881,4,everything was we tried frying it in little cubes first which came out like tofu croutons they were on our salad then we tried making them as suggested and they were also very but not as crispy next time i will use olive oil instead of canola which splattered all over the kitchen and wasn t as flavorful and experiment with different herbs and spices they were a little bland for my taste you for this base for pac 2008,420
8143,292507,5,this was a i also added an extra banana on top of the whipped topping for decoration and it looked just as wonderful as it tasted you so much for this my family loved it,169
4342,38937,5,this is a fantastic quick and taste wonderful i actually found this by searching for recipes with the ingredients i had on hand so needless to say i didn t expect too much truth is i ve spent far more money on plenty of recipes and have gotten much worse results instead of using the crockpot i boiled the meat for about an hour until it was tender then added all the ingredients together and let it simmer for about 20 minutes then i added about 2 tablespoons of sour cream to the finished product,498
1356,2001581180,5,today is the 2nd time i have this i used a packet of taco seasoning only omitting the sal in the they were,106
43509,1290903,5,as if you need another 5 star rating these were so and moist the only thing i did to this was add a half bag of mini chocolate chips that i had on hand this is a keeper mizznezz,177
203497,2002206496,3,i this for my mom to try and she said it was ok probably would have tasted better if the bread was thicker i was going to myself some but by the time i finished the first two slices the butter was gross and the pan started burning so i didn t get to mine,254
43889,112907,5,this was wonderful so and so flavorful i didn t change the at bit except to use the option of bouillon instead of the beef paste my husband and family loved it my husband requested to have it for dinner again this evening we still have some leftovers i used a big roast so much for sharing this one,298
29068,106105,5,ok this was soooooooo i cant believe it nor could anyone else who tasted it it was so that we had to go buy a bottle of vodka and it potent summer drink or a summer drink either way was,185
233102,302689,4,it took me three attempts to get the caramel right but once i go it it was smooth sailing i used slightly less ground cardamon and an egg replacer to veganize i found the spice almost over powering but my dinner guests loved it for zwt 7 the hot pink ladies,257
13445,167242,5,i loved this i could eat it every day even my hubby who doesn t get excited about not meat meals liked it i added tons more garlic about a whole head and probably more than tripled the cumin we like things flavorful this is a and very adaptable to your own tastes so much will again and again,292
391498,1991101,5,dynamite i can t believe that no one has rated this yet it s the perfect combination of flavors i separated the mixture and tried one with pecans and the other without seriously i can t choose a favorite both are equally i went and this for an office party and everyone was asking who brought that coleslaw it was a huge hit even my kids liked it for posting,358
311688,2002770368,5,one of my all time favourite things to eat,42
271834,519562,5,i love your i m a big fan and so is my family,45
147539,2733462,5,this is so will add this to my favorite soups lt br gt two of us ate most of the pot,84
66054,61143,5,this potato dish was a total hit with me and my family i followed your exactly and the potatoes turned out soft and tender with that rich and sauce doesn t get any easier geema for a,182
101273,488617,5,this is similar to another that i today i the exactly as written and it was very next time i ll add a third can of tomato soup a can of corn and a bit more seasoning,165
26339,223325,4,when adding the cheddar cheese we also topped each piece of chicken with a tbsp of mild tomato salsa it was wonderful we will certainly it again,144
375619,1072892,4,this was very to however it was just a tad bit too sweet for me otherwise i would have given it 5 stars mangos are naturally sweet and i think the extra sugar wasn t really needed but that s just my taste i mixed it with sparkling mineral water because i don t like to drink soda anymore so i m always looking for something to jazz up selzer or mineral water you for sharing this sharon,386
107544,152750,5,this is my favorite cheesecake wonderful balance of flavors i recently started using a bain marie when baking my cheesecakes and i can t tell you what a difference it s in my finished product my cakes perfectly look beautiful and not one crack if you haven t tried it yet i d highly recommend you give it a shot,311
26773,1132728,5,this hits the spot every time i it on the stove and add a lot more cocoa powder it is perfect for a cold winter day,115
57340,135377,3,on beer can chicken,19
100006,469723,5,so basic to just whip it up i changed nothing but qualify that i used white raisins and because they seem sweeter than dark raisins reduced their amount kathleen,161
56978,339544,5,i love making sweet potatoes this way like the other reviewer i wrap them in foil two big potatoes cook in about 4 hours on high,128
322181,296098,5,how can something so quick and taste so this was marvelous and i added a dollop of whipped cream i used a plain white bread i wonder how it would be with croissants i used some of the most blueberries i have ever tasted plus my half and half was not fat free i also added the cinnamon sugar,290
109283,932717,5,the first time i it i must of used quite a large lemon because it was a little too zesty so i cut back on the zest the second time i am making it tonight and i think i will add a bit more garlic as others have suggested,219
73866,243711,5,perfection that s what i said when i sliced into this perfect prime rib i followed the exactly it was so and i ended up not having much time between 1st cooking and 2nd maybe 30 minutes and i was worried but needn t have been meat temp was 140 when i took it out and it was perfectly med rare,292
35368,38717,5,this sounds wonderful i m going to try this using old elpasto jalapeno relish i love that relish in my salsa and other dishes too you for sharing your,150
69281,262090,5,just as described this is bursting with flavour i used one large eggplant and it worked fine i only used 1 2 tsp bean paste which was enough for the kids i tossed in vietnamese meat balls vietnamese meatballs which worked well,226
237369,1168148,5,really this today i omitted the peas as we don t like them and added chicken instead and added more soya sauce,110
103832,26535,5,holy crap this is seriously beyond outstanding and sooooo to it s ridiculous i used about a 1 4 cup of onion and 4 breasts we like sauce so i put in approx 1 2c of peanut butter 1 c of broth and about 1 4 c of honey i would have put in more but that was literally all i had i did use 3 tsp of the curry and the flavor was the last addition for me was about a 1 4 tsp of frank s hot sauce for that red pepper heat that added just a tiny bit of kick without changing the flavors yum i let the dish simmer on low for about 20 25 minutes while i waited for the rice to cook this the chicken incredibly tender then right at the end of cooking time i added about a 1 4 c of heavy cream wow boyfriend and i love this dish will mos def stay in the rotation you,752
142,513784,5,absolutely i used 4 egg whites and 1 whole egg added one extra banana and cut down on the butter a little bit because of it used 2 3 cup of amaretto and omitted the almonds because i didn t have any on hand even with my substitutions the cake still came out so moist and perfect to a glaze i boiled 1 4 cup sugar and 1 8 water with some almond extraxt and then poured it over the hot cake it gave it a crispy sugary glaze on top the only change i ll next time is to let it sit for a day before serving because i found the almond flvouring really came through when i had a piece a day later instead of the day it was i think this will definitely become a family favourite,670
3470,1800038781,5,so even a dad can it,20
66241,118493,5,excellent have several times and cut ingredients in half so there is just enough for hubby and i the other day when friends were over did not have buttermilk so used a mixture of plain yogurt and milk to buttermilk portion turned out wonderful would probably be with vanilla yogurt too,285
48122,336811,5,absolutely fabulous dish it was light and flavorful and the spices were just right the crunch in the topping was a additiong and a welcomed change to the usual sweet potato recipes out there definitely a worth keeping for posting,229
35805,115525,5,i have to add my praises for this dough it is indeed eazy peezy texture and chew i did not pre bake and then add toppings i went for it on the raw dough my breadmaker has a one hour pizza dough cycle and it worked out beautifully very manageable and workable although it was a tad sticky straight from the machine i love doughy pizza but next time i ll two pizzas instead of one,378
29800,776318,5,this is a sauce i too omitted the honey and next time i will cut back to 1 1 2 tbl mayo didn t need salt pepper i m glad i found this here angela,145
144905,237533,5,fantastic i kicked up the pepper and did a bit of cayenne pepper also used onions instead of leeks cause i did all this with what i had on hand used up carrots celery leftover turkey etc you for posting this,207
403844,2383143,5,excellent and tasted i used my cuisinart electric pressure cooker and it came out wonderfully only recommendation is to let the sit for a little while or keep on warm so some of the wetness can dry out,201
420398,359724,5,oh man so happy to have this my grandma died and took the with her you are a life saver,87
53474,607260,3,although it was it was a bit too close to tasting like chili,60
53914,305664,5,wow we loved this for sharing,29
107997,692885,5,this was quick and,18
44021,21399,3,i used 4 sugar pumpkins rather then one large pumpkin because i thought it would be fun to have your own individual serving this was to but seemed to be lacking something different for everyone eating it alicia thought it needed to have diced tomatoes robbie thought it needed a bit of cheese in the meat i was thinking more garlic my favorite layer was the cabbage layer instead of shredding cabbage i bought a bag of coleslaw mix that had both green and purple cabbage as well as a little bit of carrot in it i it with vegetable juice because that is what i had on hand it is an off brand and mostly tomato juice anyway so it worked well i suggest sprinkling the inside of your pumpkin with a bit of kosher salt because the pumpkin was a little bland without out it also if you mix the contents together including the cooked pumpkin sides you might top it all off with a pad of butter to melt into the contents it also enriches the flavor of the pumpkin as well as the cabbage and green beans the whole thing smelled fantastic baking my smaller pumpkins were done in about an hour and a half which left the green beans a perfect crisp tender you for an interesting and fun meal,1179
14303,343665,5,texture and taste and isn t it just the best to know that it s healthy too we ll definitely be making this regularly as part of our twice a week vegetarian dinners,163
110506,2002311032,5,these turned out the topping is and they are just perfect for fall events i followed the recipie exactly as it is and it was flavor will again for sure,151
5194,2001797807,5,turned out perfect didn t change the until taste test and at that point i garnished with fresh thyme you for sharing until this didn t like ham and scalloped potatoes will this again,182
100626,220361,5,i can t find the words to express how tender juicy and absolutely fabulous this was we loved this and you you you for introducing us to sweet baby ray s,152
94226,241882,5,excellent i only had a jar of mushrooms and it was still what a way to bring up the taste of snow peas for posting this dish,124
26516,511690,5,loved it i m not usually a mayo fan so i wasn t sure about the topping sauce but it was i don t like cilantro so i used chopped spinach instead i ve passed this on to every one of my friends you,194
54752,1571888,5,scrumptious i couldn 039 t even tell i was eating turkey this with 93 ff only had one lb meat used 1 2 c uncooked oats for the starch used italian tomato paste for catsup spiced it up with cayenne and included 1 2 bell pepper as suggested by others meat muffins cooked perfectly in 35 minutes will be a fave from now on,319
84770,2001621561,5,yes this is my except for the leek it is cold as well i love feta so the more the merrier,89
344580,2822173,5,this was a light and refreshing punch not too sweet i used white grape peach and froze an ice ring with sliced peaches in it,124
38966,414988,1,this cake was super after reading all the positive reviews i looked forward to making it and then after reading the negative cake was already in the oven slightly worried about my cake i was reassured when i took it out of the oven and all seemed to be well if i had left a review right then it would have been a one sigh i sincerely hate to leave bad reviews but this just didn t work everything seemed fine at first i followed the directions exactly and everything looked after letting the cake cool i went back into the kitchen to frost it here is where it all fell apart literally i don t mean that the cake split in half or a chunk of the corner fell off i mean the entire thing crumbled it was like powder i am not new to baking i have many years of cakes under my belt i have had many disastrous outcomes as well as many ones this was unlike anything i have ever seen boyfriend said it s kind of like corn bread and i guess that would be the best way to describe it except cornbread is dense this was like old foam the green kind they used to put in fake potted plants that just crumbled into dust after 20 years in the sun i have no idea how it went from looking so to corn bread cake dust in just a few hours i m sorry it was just a complete fail,1255
230240,967098,4,this is a super fast super meal i actually 2 batches of it one we cooked and ate right away and the other i have frozen in a foodsaver bag for a second meal later in the month i added a bit of pineapple juice and a can of pineapple tidbits in with the soup and vinegar served over brown rice w broccoli on the side was,318
50022,2915658,5,this was the absolute best banana bread that i ve ever eaten i doubled the and three loaves total using disposable aluminum pans i wanted one loaf for our household and two loaves for my husband to share with his busy colleagues since the pans are thin i checked them after only 60 minutes they were done so i pulled them out at that time i ve tried recipes before that were rather sunken in the middle after cooking but not this the loaves were nicely shaped and the perfect size the bread also had the perfect texture not to heavy not too dense but still delightfully moist and while my bananas were definitely in the brown skin stage they were not at the quot black quot stage i got impatient after a week and half of waiting and decided to use them anyway it was still the best tasting banana bread that i ve,812
255422,159532,5,i have only one negative thing to say about this dish for two really not at my house ok ok so it should have served two i just ate it all it was really really really i think maybe i ll go and some more seriously once cheese was mentioned i had to try it that way but it was also wonderful without for such a that is so and even with cheap balsamic,347
232944,744296,5,even my 18mo old enjoyed it and asked for thirds a complete success instead of using dill ranch dressing i used 246720 for team ssassy for zwt6 zingo,149
43990,364530,5,this for a holiday gift and got reviews from it very to i also discovered that the cinnamon apple mixture is pretty as a treat on its own,137
255288,412337,3,i changed everything about this but it was a foundation for what turned out to be one of the best chicken soups i ve ever tasted shitaki mushrooms are key thinly sliced and lots of em bouquet the rosemary don t add it chopped i used roasted garlic in the veggies and pot celery isn t necessary unless you love it extra salt was a must i used the remains of half a rotisserie chicken for this save for leftovers,410
26330,365368,5,quick and i couldn t ask for anything more from a for sharing,61
50722,2000600978,5,i these for my mom because she wasn 039 t feeling well these were so to and they tasted i also used a different icing here is the link http allrecipes com 9926 cream cheese frosting ii i this as a half batch with 1tbs of vanilla and that covered the lot of cinnamon buns perfectly,280
19151,137765,5,very a real guy pleaser i liked mine with mayo rather than italian dressing,75
73224,485353,5,the best cookies i have ever i did them with choco and peanut chips the first time came out perfect the next time i used white chocolate and peanut butter chips and they came out perfect again this is an award winner,216
15559,1312831,5,beware your cake mix most are now only 15 25oz this is probably fine as written but if your cake mix is only 15 25oz you should definitely reduce your oil,154
42624,44858443,5,i these for super bowl and they were a hit i adjusted the slightly as recommended by other reviewers i added an extra egg reduced oyster cracker crumbs to 1 1 2 cups and used 2 tbsp of butter to saut eacute the veggies i brushed the mushrooms with melted butter before stuffing and used mozzarella cheese on top i also drizzled more butter on top before baking baked 12 minutes then broiled a few minutes to slightly brown the cheese they tasted better than red lobster 039 s stuffed mushrooms lt br gt will defiantly these again you for a,539
145165,987258,5,my entire family really enjoyed this corn the pot was empty after when dinner was over and my hubby asked me to keep it in the rotation you for a wonderful,155
128362,351375,5,for my family last week my girls 7 and 4 loved it very flavorful and to,71
24573,472690,5,very as a present for a couple of people and they loved them too exactly as directed except i always add a little extra vanilla but just a note it about 30 cookies rather than 48 and i didn t them huge,201
155699,310156,4,we added cilantro to the marinade this chicken turned out and juicy i would have liked a little more zest so next time i will add garlic,136
179585,457992,5,i loved it i used beech smoked tofu and it worked deliciously you for the dip recommendation too it worked beautifully with the crispiness i m not a big fan of tofu but this might have changed my mind,200
169935,4770863,4,quick and but needs some seasonings or it comes out a bit bland,63
32554,548406,3,the topping was really and the part of the cake that it oozed into was too i just think that the cake part needed more flavour the was super to follow and very quick to put together,181
332283,532289,5,i don t even have to wait for my racks to come out of the tub to rate this i put my racks in the tub with 1 2 c liquid detergent because i don t have powder i set the shower head to hard spray to mix the soap and the grime was already coming off as i filled the tub i don t know why i never thought to place the racks in the tub so much easier they fit and i don t get the gunk all over the kitchen trying to fit them in a sink that is just way to small for posting this idea,475
340621,1587200,5,i love this bread super and i ve passed along to anyone who will listen essentially and it s also revived my delight in soup making after all what goes better with fresh bread than soup for a,191
20408,1162751,5,my 3 year old and i these tonight they are the best he will bring some to school for his teachers tomorrow but he wants to keep some at home,140
395338,2002572618,4,the toes were very almost as as my cat s,40
15060,7802,5,excellent we used earl campbell s spicy hot links as the sausage and it was fantastic this is my kind of meal on a cold winter day we served jalapeno cheese grits with it but a batch of cornbread would be a natural as well for posting this it will be many times in our house i m sure,283
53133,980012,4,very the pork came out perfectly cooked i gave it four stars instead of five because i altered the a bit and used shallots instead of onions so can not accurately rate the also i doubled the sauce and served the extra over rice i love sauces,241
115137,169122,4,this is a really for creating as bergy suggests your own version according to what vegetables you have on hand i added minced garlic when i sauteed the chicken and i put in more vegetables than called for i didn t have any sweet hot chili sauce so i just used 2 teaspoons of regular asian chili paste which it really hot the way dh and i like it but since the brown sugar was in there it still turned out pleasantly sweet we ll definitely this again,449
72479,2200190,5,first time i this and it was and so flavourful i mixed it up a little and put buffalo mozzarella and some fresh basil in between the prosciutto the chicken will definitely be making this again and again,202
115153,1157312,5,hubby and i loved it but the kids didn t give it a chance between us he and i ate it all i expected the top to brown but as it turns out the bottom browns so i had one side a bit too dark but still very we will definitely it again,230
102620,2310450,5,this was wonderful i did it in the crockpot and did have to keep my eye on it and stir and add extra broth i homemade vegetable broth so i just kept adding as necessary my husband love it as well this enough to freeze a gallon ziplock full of it i will this again and again,273
158337,253710,3,this was an dinner to put together it did not take any time at all i had most of the ingredients except for the ground turkey and the canned beans no substitutions were but i only used 28 oz of tomatoes because i had 14 oz cans on hand i did not think it needed more at all in fact i would personally prefer 14 oz of tomatoes but that is my own taste my kids liked this as it was but my husband and i dumped more chili powder on our portions once i did that it was for a low fat quick meal,489
106554,1210564,4,turned out excellent and the dough was a little crumbly to spread in the jelly roll pan i thought perhaps i did something wrong and it it difficult to brush egg white on it as well i simply pressed the crumbs down and the best of it but i was surprised that it came out just fine next time i will balls and press them into cookies,330
52500,177688,5,i used 1 can corn 1 can beans 1 3 c scallions 1 4 c cilantro 2 tb lime juice 1 tsp olive oil 1 4 tsp cumin 1 2 tsp kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste i reduced the cumin because i ve often found it to be too overpowering in black bean and corn salads and i think i did the right thing i love this salad especially with a liberal dash of tabasco chipotle hot sauce,381
25400,593424,5,boys just loved this one along with our baked chicken this is an extremely that we all would like to have again for sharing,123
53914,261963,5,this is fabulous the only changes i were to omit the green onion and sub a little cayenne for the hot pepper sauce i used the broiler and this is a keeper shared it with everyone at work for a,192
25459,45019,5,i ve the herbed biscuit version of these several times but i use 2 cups whole wheat flour instead of part wheat and part white i also just drop them instead of actually cutting them out they go as a side dish with a little butter on them very,242
37413,2687969,5,very i pretty much followed the but using 2 25 lbs ground beef and two onion soup mix envelopes i 6 large hamburger steaks and could only fit 4 in while browning both sides however after browning all six fit in the same pan so i could the gravy it turned out my family loved it,277
21864,275207,5,absolutely delightful as a first time ever bread maker this was to follow and produced results the resulting loaves are sooo much lighter and purer in flavor than storebought i used king arthur bread flour bob s red mill organic whole wheat flour and wegmans all purpose flour the crust was and firm resistant at first to cutting but giving way to a nicely chewy inside the wheat and honey flavors blend beautifully together as noted truly a delightful experience all around will definitely be making this as well as other breads again and woe to my waistline,559
129166,1029636,5,wonderful and if its raining and you can t grill then 6 minutes per side under the broiler works nicely with 1 5 salmon steaks i basted when i flipped them over terrific flavor,176
51092,473393,4,i used carrots and added cinnamon it tasted a lot like pumpkin pie,66
37297,56000,5,this was i loved waking up and having breakfast ready next time i it i will add more meat and probably a little less hashbrowns otherwise this is definately a keeper mark,170
271125,930510,5,i think this was very got alot of reviews on it but i think it was a lil to much pepperoni i will def this again with less pepperoni to and two 1 2 trays so it is for a party you for posting,190
323941,1859030,5,mmmmmm didnt change a thing receipe you,39
78237,296544,5,i just these today and other than using half whole wheat flour half white and subbing out part of the almond extract for lemon i ran out of almond i followed the exactly with results yum i ve been craving biscotti for days and i knew i could trust kittencal s my 2 boys loved dipping them in milk too i had a bit of trouble slicing them with my bread knife but i also had a 4 year old begging for cookies at my elbow i know i ll be making these often and my slicing should improve with practice,494
18200,2001991171,5,i ve this bread countless times i love it so much it tastes dipped in olive oil and balsamic vinegar plus makes the house smell,127
267807,101714,5,although there a lot of broccoli salad recipes on the zaar i tried this one because of the christmas in the name i particularly liked the addition of the sweet red peppers i used red onion instead of green rice vinegar instead of cider vinegar sunflower seeds instead of pecans and added dried cranberries to it even more christmas y like another reviewer i added sugar 1 tbsp of organic sugar to the dressing also used light hellman s mayo and center cut bacon to cut down on the fat and calories my dinner party group snarfed it down,535
94822,317004,5,this for my daughter s dance recital a couple of weeks ago and it was we used fresh strawberries we had picked ourselves and it was like eating a slice of spring for your help kitten it was a ending for the evening after her recital,232
43592,57939,4,i ve found a new comfort it has a really taste consistency not runny at all the only problem was it s a little bit too salty i wouldn t reduce the soy sauce but next time i m trying low sodium cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soups i used canned mushrooms and half of a very large spanish onion cause that s what i had i topped it with a 3 oz can of chinese noodles which gave a texture to the casserole i served it with corn and a rice mixture as suggested the casserole is a definite keeper but as stated previously it needs to be adapted a little to my taste,567
285632,1806667,5,simmering to reduce is a must on this i tasted it before and after reduction and it makes a huge difference i also thought it needed a little pepper after tasting the finished sauce so i added 1 4 tsp ground black pepper it now has a better balance with the acidity level a very change of pace to bbq i ll be using this again,325
160500,144635,4,hottopot this was very had no sauce so finger lickin bbq sauce 19023 in the pot put the 3 lb shoulder roast in cooked on high for about 5 hours then on low about 3 removed the bone and the fat and put the meat back in the sauce to reheat served on buns will again,263
35520,547750,4,mmmm chocolately goodness over ice cream with banana and mango i had a little bit of difficulty dissolving the sugar it looked like it was about to turn into hard caramel i probably had the heat too high so i added a splash of milk that worked a treat the cocoa mixed in easily and the sauce was and smooth the rum was a touch and just right to go over tropical fruits,368
12849,313267,5,these are very very we had to them 3 times in a row and my 11 year old kept complaining that i was eating up all his cookies i ve been looking at the reviews where they say to use a whole candy and we haven t done that yet but i might be tempted happy holidays and for the,272
169114,231198,5,these are tdf i these to take on our vacation to the lake had to sample them as i was packing them up a cook always tests her wares for posting coffeemom,153
195331,844307,5,i wasn 039 t sure how this would be without the canned green beans but i liked it even better than the original version to have a slightly healthier version of an old classic,174
142061,341435,5,it s all in the sauce this is my new favorite sauce i have used it over and over in every italian dish i have bayhill wonderful,127
23687,21399,5,i know you don t really need another review on this but i had to tell you that it was excellent my sis and her bf had their hearts set on their usual fried turkey but mine was set on trying a brine for the first time we had 2 13 lb turkeys for 8 people i was so worried that it would be salty because of the salt content in the brine it was not salty in the least the flavors were subtle and the color of the finished bird was beautiful a wonderful rich dark brown mine was the prettiest and in my opinion anyway the tastiest of the 2 birds i plan to try your maple brine for christmas for a new experience and a very thanksgiving dinner mc,640
66688,75846,4,flavor quick and i added about 2 tsp garlic powder i did have to cook for a little longer about 25 minutes kids really liked it too,131
133826,2606322,1,oops posted before i was done neither my husband or son are picky eaters and they were not into it at all shame was a waste of eggs cheese and bacon don t bother with this one,175
108348,373998,5,okay here was our situation a dairy and other things allergic girl going to a tea party at a friend s house where the menu was little frou frou y cakes and other snacks that were totally off limits for her we this filling dairy free by substituting in soy cream cheese replaced the strawberry jam with raspberry and dropped the vanilla wafers after blending the filling used a mixer we sandwiched it between soft white bread that we cut into heart shapes with a cookie cutter very cute very and it looks on a tray the filling also makes a dip for apples and is wonderful spread on bagels it stores well in the fridge do we miss dairy spreads not anymore chef fifi for a versatile,679
91318,128646,4,this was really a super that i will really look forward to cooking in the summer when i don t want to heat up the kitchen oh and i used hot n spicy spike seasoning mixed with a little bit of ranch dressing powder,212
32204,359856,5,fantastic a mite too sweet though i ll probably reduce the sugar in the future for a,84
158508,1865140,5,i did a couple things differently just amounts though the only thing i would even consider changing is the amount of alfredo sauce and spinach less spinach and more alfredo sauce it tastes almost identical to olive garden it s my husband s favorite dish there and we decided to try it at home couldn t have found a better i don t believe,337
88945,291296,5,wonderful we loved the flavor and texture i this with my microwave stuffed porkchops 257560 they only take 18 mins so it was very to have a fast healthy dinner,159
194700,654061,5,so and i will it again,22
17000,82648,5,garlic adds a wonderful flavour,31
506103,2221474,5,this is the same one my mother used to i think the was very popular in the 60 039 s and early 70 039 s it is refreshing and has texture and the color is pleasing to the eye it is one of the salads that was always in the refrigerator be sure to rinse the kidney beans,266
8590,137895,5,these wings are a big hit in our house and at all our get togethers everyone asks for the everytime someone goes out for wings we get a call to let us know that ours were better for posting this one it s a keeper in our house,225
39901,12099,5,terrific i it even more decadent by topping it all with a 2nd layer of the chocolate without the krispies for an extra thick chocoholic s dream,143
25840,509707,5,absolutely the family loved it and no evacuation necessary for sharing laurie and roger,87
42959,153401,4,i picked this for one of my recipes in the my three chefs challange my 9 year old daughter them with very little help from me they are almost exactly like the ones you get at red lobster the only problem she had with them was that the amount of milk was not enough we ended up having to add more in order to get it all mixed up i did find out at the end that i was out of italian herb seasoning so i just added a couple of dashes of dried basil and oregano to replace it i will this again making a note to add more milk,519
158050,300912,5,what a legend pete this sounds so i m going to cook them next time we have a bbq,80
43835,169844,4,really and to i dipped mine in dark chocolate and sprinkled some with nuts,74
11149,594620,5,out of this world chili it was simply perfect i did a few alterations 1 i had to leave out the beans because my daughter is allergic it was still without them even though it would have been even better with them 2 i used 1 tablespoon chili powder instead of the 2 teaspoons 3 i added 1 cup of water at the end as it was a little thick for our liking this it perfect 4 i chopped up one very large green pepper and added that with the tomatoes and spices perfect we all like spicy foods in this house except for my daughter however we all like varying degrees of spiciness we found the cayenne pepper on the side works for this everyone can spice it to his her own liking this chili is with crackers fritos really or pasta it was just fabulous all around my husband has always thought his chili was the best ever and he even admitted tonight that he s been out cooked in the chili department d so much for the keeper marty,920
216350,450060,4,i didn t feel like carving out and stuffing strawberries and so i did these deviled eggs style sliced them lengthwise and piled on a scoop of cheesecake i used the ready philly whipped cheesecake spread and dipped in crushed chocalate graham crackers crumbs delish,264
66941,675287,5,my bf and i cooked this out on the grill with results using the indirect heating method turning one side of the grill on high and letting it heat up for 15 minutes then placing the chicken on the opposite side of the grill i used chicken breasts and reserved some of the marinade to spoon on the chicken as it was cooking the chicken took about 47 minutes to be done perfectly with the juices running clear it was so tender and we love the marinade and will use this from now on when cooking out on the grill for sharing merrie,527
49172,238201,5,these are wonderful and addicting i had 5 even before they were cool eat one then kept coming back my son also loved them they were very to and when there fresh out of the oven,176
64809,625885,5,omg this was a hit at my last bbq everyone asked me for the the flavors are wonderful and its so i have it 3 times already this week the kids have asked for it again this weekend so much if i could give you 10 stars i would,223
453599,646304,3,i struggled with rating this because i want to be fair to both you for posting and readers looking for honest reviews i these cupcakes several months ago while pregnant and looking for a lemon fix the taste was but the cupcakes completely fell apart i thought it was something i did so i tried again and they simply don t hold together i forgot to remove it from my book and looking for a lemon fix these again a few days ago they just crumble apart no matter what even when i let them rest in the pan after cooking again the taste of all three layers was,555
98869,2001442496,5,i this into a cupcake and it turned out,39
315151,312363,5,no fail is right i added salt fresh ground pepper garlic powder wasabi powder and rosemary for my spices i put the spices on the night before and then followed your cooking directions exactly the result was a perfectly cooked medium rare prime rib,247
189133,1800127378,5,i 039 ve tired many tiramisu recipes over the last month and this one is the best i don 039 t use the wine because children will be enjoying this i do not cook the egg i 039 ve tried that technique it turns out too runny i love that this uses the egg whites it adds a pluffyness plus i 039 m not wasting perfectly egg whites it took me around one hour to put it together first time be carfull you don 039 t over soak the lady fingers also the brand of lady fingers seems to have a different outcome i am using savoiardi,519
68315,181127,5,absolutely fab i had to use frozen hash browns as thats all there was came out beautifully dh loved it wants it often,117
120519,792731,5,i these on whole wheat english muffins with a slice of turkey bacon and a slice of cheddar they are really excellent but i would not recommend using the muffin pan i used a nonstick muffin pan and sprayed it besides and while the eggs came out easily the muffin pan was extremely messy and it probably took me about 45 mins to clean it a little i wonder if it might be okay with a silicone muffin pan but i might be too scared to try it i definitely want to them again though they are wonderful,494
18774,272834,5,i gave these as gifts to a few of my dog lover friends they were a huge hit and super to i didn t have any milk powder so i used some protein powder instead i also substituted meat drippings for the oil this 70 3 inch dog bones,227
103152,121269,5,absolutely loved it even though i didn t pre toast the bread i will follow directions next time so much i going to try another one of your recipes,146
122848,196470,5,this was i used slightly less that 1 tbsp of mustard and i didn t have sweet pickle relish so i used 3 tbsp of brown sugar this is the second time that i these sloppy joes and the first time i did use the sweet pickle relish delish i also added a small amount of diced green peppers only because i hadn t found this before i added them to the ground beef there were no leftovers,378
359929,2001832057,5,fantastic i use ocean spray dried cranberries craisins with 50 less sugar i use paul newman s raspberry vinaigrette my favorite salad with the addition of sliced pears or sliced apples i sometimes use baby spinach leaves instead of the spring mix too,250
147796,1475135,2,they were but i didnt think they were anything special i was expecting a wow factor and was underwhelmed,104
18641,41338,5,and very i like it better than tacos,36
8635,427033,5,this cake was wonderful i didn t have a german chocolate cake so i put chocolate chips on the bottom of the pan with the pecans and coconut and used a yellow cake it turned out,176
341579,2002779815,5,a few reviews said these were dry so i added an extra egg and them as directed they turned out fantastic and i will absolutely these again but i will omit 1 2 a cup of the raisins and add 1 2 a cup of chopped nuts,213
57092,123864,5,this is a with taste i ve never had salmon with such flavor i also cooked the fish in the marinade idea i ll definately cook this dish again,140
52624,1872545,5,i this for dinner this evening and the sauce was very flavorful i think however next time i will try cayenne pepper instead of black just to kick it up a notch,159
155369,432636,5,excellent bread i didn t have any problems with the exactly as it was written i did not need extra water as soon as it came out of the machine we cut it and ate it crisp crust i set it to medium and super fluffy soft inside,223
135350,804931,5,no kidding this is the best i omitted the bread crumbs and it got and crusty on the top and just like we like it all cheesy and in the middle,141
13157,370903,5,i really liked this cake it was very to i it with half whole wheat flour and half baking flour and substituted soyamilk for milk increase the amount if using whole wheat flour it was very we finished it off in a day you for this,228
136201,86244,5,this was so and quick for a dish that tasted like you put a whole lot more work into it very hope you like spicy cuz that andouille will get ya,143
2373,582614,5,i tried this out last night and it was my picky fincee loved it as well i didn t have any green onions or cheddar cheese so i used sauteed yellow onion and 2 mozerrella cheese and it still came out fabulous was very to prepare and i will definitely be making it many times in the future can t wait to try it with the cheddar and scallions,338
148600,722912,5,we 2 versions one with white chocolate chips cream cheese frosting and peppermint extract the other with semi sweet chips and chocolate frosting both were and very,163
21706,2854598,5,this is just the only thing i did change was to add a little ricotta cheese into the dish for a little more creamy flavor a,123
303178,808063,5,lots of banana flavour,22
31244,249381,5,i don t even like green beans and i couldn t stop eating these i them for my family and friends and they were all raving about it you so much for a and yum,155
21597,2001614466,5,these were muffins these muffins with a few slight changes added more milk because batter was really thick and it did only 9 10 muffins double or triple the amount of cinnamon sugar mixture to dip muffin tops in after baked and they were well done at 18 minutes so you may want to keep an eye on them as for the taste delish,324
340215,1198491,5,my 9 mos old loves this it cooked fairly quickly pureed nicely i used a large sweet potato and homemade veggie broth it s to be able to your own baby you can tweak it to your baby s liking this is very healthy and,213
169672,444622,5,this is a pound cake and the lemon glaze so i didnt have cake flour so i used all purpose and i think my pound cake was a bit heavier than described by other reviewers but still very a bit of lemon curd would also be along side you galley wench for posting this a new favorite for us,283
19424,535867,5,muffins to with success i added 1 tsp of vanilla doubled the as well as extra chocolate chips as recommended by another chef mmmmmm zaar always just a tap away diane ontario canada,180
58823,572912,5,disregard my previous rating i accidentally rated the wrong this one sounds though,82
38523,179642,5,this ice cream took about 2 minutes to mix up no prep ahead of time and it tasted excellent i have to admit i forgot the half and half and ended up using all whipping cream it was excellent,189
38642,192852,5,touch with the caraway seeds never tried that before caraway seeds gave it a bit more 039 depth 039 for posting,111
447482,1607994,3,i increased the amount of cake mix and decreased the amount of flour the flavor and texture greatly depend on the quality of the cake mix that you use when served straight from the skillet the cake batter flavor was lacking but as the pancakes cooled the flavor came out more,275
32204,1200137,5,very be careful of adding mini marshmallows as i fould it would cause the brownies to melt over and not quite set up right when put in mini muffin pans,151
8600,1076928,4,my boyfriend and i really liked this we them last night and it was fun to do together i didn t have parsley so i just added a ton of dry italian seasoning to the cheese mixture and it seemed to have a flavor for spaghetti sauce i used a tomato basil which went very nicely with the cheese filling i m sure we ll these again,323
5194,1457659,5,i was remiss in not rating this the first time i it or the second but this is absolutely received with relish by everyone i ve it for will look for more recipes from you dancer you ve not disappointed us yet kudos cheers bravo,226
11919,1126087,4,this was very it did need a little more fluid than the stated so i added about 1 2 cup of beef broth i also left out the parsley and didn t feel we were missing anything it was wonderful,186
18197,514992,5,i fried some of these up tonight half in the fryer with peanut oil at 375 and half in the frying pan with olive oil and butter the ones fried in the fryer were more attractive but i thought the flavor of the ones in the frying pan was superior my 15 year old son preferred the ones in the fryer though he just doesn t know how to appreciate the olive oil flavor i guess i used a couple of eggs with a couple of tbsp of milk as others have suggested as well as a liberal amount of salt and pepper both in the cracker meal and in the egg i can t say i ve had these before but i can guarantee i ll be having them again for an,622
360590,1065385,5,i a slightly different lemon cream cheese frosting so i can t speak to the frosting the cakes themselves were divine my husband gave them 10 stars and lemon cake is his favorite i was using bottled juice so i doubled the juice and did not have any zest the lemon flavor was still very subtle the cakes are like a pound cake and for the 5 days that we had leftovers after a birthday party they stayed moist and in the fridge,423
146092,293153,4,really and worth the effort this was my second time making it and i would agree with other reviewers that it s a bit salty will have to remember that for christmas,163
16727,1013852,5,this was on a cold night and came together easily being from maryland however and loving old bay i added quite a bit extra after tasting you,140
361996,597622,5,this was so very i m new to the vegan thing so i was looking for tvp and couldn t find it and used tempeh instead which could very well be the tvp but it turned out and i was surprised at how much it tasted like chicken i will this again and yes some of my nuggets fell apart and some stayed together nicely i think i am going to try and bake them like the other reviewer did next time i them and see how that works though,422
64462,96156,4,very ribs i varied the slightly always looking for shortcuts i used a 10oz bag of frozen chopped onions less would have sufficed a full cup of apple butter and 1 2 1 tsp of jar garlic i keep refrigerated the is but i have to agree with another review very fatty maybe try a pork roast next time also the cooking time was too long because the ribs were broken into tiny pieces i may also try this at a lower cooking time perhaps checking tenderness at 6hrs i would have given this 5stars but the 9 hour low cooking time was just too long with my smart crockpot but it s worth a repeat and my husband liked it too mizznezz,620
453722,316094,5,this salad is excellent the tahini gives it an almost creamy mouthfeel and the greens add a freshness the cucumbers especially give it a crunchy texture that adds a lot of interest to the dish this is a keeper i ll be making it on a regular basis for sure,255
97240,193063,5,this is fantastic the mussels came out better than any i 039 ve had in belgium and that 039 s saying a lot i was just there a few weeks ago lt br gt lt br gt i a few substitutions dried herbs instead of fresh omitting the tarragon as i didn 039 t have any shallots in place of the regular onion and french garlic parsley compound butter at the end lt br gt lt br gt i wanted to drink the sauce with a straw it was so but i used a crusty baguette instead lol we 039 ll be making this again and again,498
299756,1466337,5,wow this was sooo i like that it was so to my family loved it,61
46078,125808,5,these are to bake up perfectly and taste them for superbowl sunday for dh to take to a friend s house to watch the game and i wondered if they would be all gone before he even left home no dip necessary for me they are all by themselves i them exactly as written and baking 10 minutes was just right if you are making these for an event you might as well go ahead and double the or you will wonder where they all disappeared to so fast,435
292829,498486,5,a very cookie crispy on the outside soft and eggy on the inside with just a hint of lemon i didn t have lemon zest or extract so i had to do with lemon juice but the took it beautifully i added lemon juice to the glaze for more lemony goodness too but otherwise excellent i ll it again,285
32921,56670,5,when i read this i knew i had to these so i it the same nite for diner the pizza crust is soooooooo its a little crunchy but mine only had 2 bake for 11 min but i did do things different i didnt put parm cheese in the crust but on top i put tomatoe slices but then on my pizza i put chicken and green red yellow peppers onions and mexican cheese a chicken fajita pizza and i one for my brother w sausage and peppers and mozzarela cheese these were sooo and the perfect siza for diner i will defeanitly be making these lil delites again they are so versatile and,561
137144,920864,4,i these and i am not sure if i did it right or not some of the other reviewers mentioned that their carrots carmelized mine did not since they were cooked with a lid they were just steamed they were but not exactly what i expected was i supposed to remove the lid at some point the word roasted would indicate so i will them again because they were and it is just sooo to put them in the oven if you are baking other parts of the meal for the i will probably mess with it next time and see if i can find the elusive carmelization,529
90762,1742738,5,i these last night and they were almost gone before the fried swai hit the table my mistake in thinking the family would hold off until i sat down haha i used the maple sugar option and will definitely stick with that option on the plus side i did get an extra serving of fish as a compensation for their behavior,313
45181,128047,5,my favorite from our fondue night i pre boiled the potatoes just until the skewer went in then tossed them in the oil and put them in the oven to reheat later i estimate they were in the oven for about 15 minutes cold oven to 350 they were perfectly cooked by that time,269
38137,1908913,5,do i hear 15 stars i thought i was in heaven for a little while,63
43509,521192,5,i loved these you,17
167348,1119670,4,very quick ahead meal i like someone else said used taco seasoning in place of chili powder and i use 1 cup salsa 1 cup tomato sauce instead of 2 cups salsa and i just use frozen corn as we don t care for canned,211
95569,415212,5,i couldnt believe how this was and it turned out so i served it with potato chips and iced tea ds said they were,112
302490,54672,5,i can t say enough about this the flavors burst in your mouth i ve never had anything quite like it and highly reccomend it i live in a town with many 5 star restaurants and this fits right in,192
470233,2001727173,5,it was i baked it for the full 20 minutes,41
57025,99195,1,you know what i ain t happy you know why because i ve got a cracked cheesecake taller than my house sitting on a rack in my kitchen right now there s a puddle of butter in my shallow baking pan and i have a cheesecake top that looks like a muffin top i don t have much hope for this cheesecake and if i m wrong i ll come back and change my review but right now it looks like i just hatched a disaster in my oven no i m definitely not happy,439
66634,664225,5,we decided on beef for ours and they were the hit of the meal my ds ate 2 and my dh ate 3 i guess you know they were totally 5 stars for us you,143
122604,136761,5,this is a real heavy dense cake i swirled a mixture of 2 tblsp cocoa 2 tblsp instant expresso powder with 4 tblsp of sugar with 1 cup of mini chocolate chips through the cake batter added a crumb topping and used an angel cake pan with a removable bottom bake an extra 15 minutes excellent for a,295
24672,29212,4,this may have turned out better if i had used the store bought cake but i one from a mix could nt find one on a late sat afternoon and i found it did nt cut as as i thought it would however that did not affect the taste and served with the strawberries it was very i will it again but will use the store bought cake next time for a new dessert inez,348
147766,135274,5,this dish is so to and is very me my kids and hubby love it the only thing is that the ww points are higher than 8 i did my own calculation per item and divided it came up as 15 points per serving,196
50374,209735,5,i just a few adjustments i used frozen corn instead of canned chicken broth instead of water and added a little cayene pepper this is definitely a keeper,153
13619,2000487935,5,this is a really pie crust my first making pie and it came out perfect you,74
31251,57018,5,i this salad for a change i halved the as i didn t think my husband and son would like it as much as i thought i would wrong the three of us really enjoyed it in fact the little that was left over for my husband s lunch my son said too bad first come first serve so he took a little more of his dad s so again it was super and best of all it didn t go soggy for a salad oh it s really to too,391
362417,1723381,5,it s vegetarian and my family asked for me to it again the next day for sharing oh and it s to too,98
29767,486718,5,this was really i didn t measure the ingrediants just eyeballed it and it was perfect,85
183689,1141280,5,this has been a classic in my family for years i can t take the sweetness of most icings and this is light and fresh tasting it is pefect with lemon cake for posting,165
68955,115517,5,what a i used chicken wingettes and the taste was simply wonderful you for this i am sure i will be making this again,117
43169,1044939,5,this came out the italian herbs really added to it i added a dash of bran and ground flax seeds for value as far as the liquid ratio you have to adjust it by texture in any bread i even think humidity affects it,211
285502,762246,5,you for this my fiance loved it i it for lunch and he rated it an 11 and asked for it again for dinner,102
94164,460048,5,i also used the green pepper and green onions with tops will this often,71
264246,914806,5,being from texas we like cornbread dressing so i substituted the leftover cornbread that i had saved for half of the seasoned stuffing mix 1 tbsp poultry seasoning had to add more broth to help moisten the cornbread but other than that i followed the exactly this is my new favorite dressing,291
3929,64032,5,just wanted to tell you i ve used your constantly since the first time i tried it i ve also given it to my sisters and it s a mainstay during the week for them too we have convection ovens now and the chicken comes even crispier than it did in the regular oven bless you,270
33029,368277,5,we thought this was the only thing i did different was i used roasted red peppers because i didn t have fresh i didn t put them in the same time as the onions i waited a minute i also didn t add the sugar and didn t miss it i did add one thing though some of the red wine i was sipping on about a quarter cup i didn t cook for full 20 minutes as my sausage was thawed out probably 10 15 minutes,394
159268,2000137099,4,i actually thought this was pretty i did greatly reduce cooking time based on reviews marinade is excellent i added marinade back to the roasting london broil halfway through cooking time and it a lovely addition for what it 039 s worth we never grilled our london broil growing up but always oven cooked it and as always it 039 s absolutely crucial to slice properly or it will remain very tough to chew,404
179860,746803,5,very salad and a to prepare ahead of time i served this with rice for zwt 6,75
33752,211836,5,i used butter instead of the vegetable oil and also added a bit more salt to the and it was perfecto my boyfriend is a huge fan of this soup so i wanted to surprise him with it and he was blown away he said it was better than any french onion he s ever had in any restaurant he might be partial but it was completely gone,321
9782,53468,5,i left the bacon out entirely saute d the onions and 2 minced fresh garlic cloves in extra virgin olive oil outstanding required no additional seasoning what s so ever serve with garlic toast and riuniti lambrusco,213
357162,919195,5,this gets a five star rating for taste and ease of preparation not having to pre cook the pasta makes this super to just mix everything together and pop it in the oven i ended up cooking mine for 55 minutes because it seemed too watery at 45 could be my oven i also added some kielbasi but instead of laying it on top of the casserole i cut it up and added it to the mixture super flavor ebbtide for a reviewed and photographed for pac spring 2009,447
26370,1803523471,5,you 039 ll be glad you decided to bake this cake i this cake for co workers and it won rave reviews it 039 s beautifully moist and not too sweet,144
269690,870928,5,loved this looking for something to cook for dinner and this was perfect i will be putting this in my permanent file meal,121
260308,668205,5,these are and outstanding the peppercorns are fabulous in this will be making alot,82
70722,172861,5,i just these and loved them i was short on cocoa so i cheated and used a 13x9 fudge brownie mix instead the brownies were and the ricotta filling was creamy and rich sugar,171
25885,886144,5,yum baked it in 2 smaller loaf pans just for 40 minutes used 21 2 cups of mashed bananas as that s all i have it was still mwah,127

26516,402057,5,my whole family loved this even my picky 6 year old,51
75658,75473,5,i just burned my old favorite chocolate chip cookie these are divine i was worried about how greasy the dough seemed to be before baking but these cookies held their shape well i used a cookie scoop and do not seem greasy at all after baking my only yielded 2 dozen cookies maybe my scoop is bigger than marie s or maybe the kids and i ate a little too much cookie dough i ll never tell marie for sharing this i highly recommend it to any chocolate chip cookie lover,466
138985,384272,5,best cut out cookie i have ever tasted very buttery i will use this whenever i cut out cookies not just for st patrick s day,124
23391,83546,5,my husband hates fish but loved this because it didn t taste fishy at all we will be using this a couple of times a month as part of our healthier eating plan,158
95569,165567,5,this was i used pamela s suggestion and bobbie s sauce bobbie q sauce barbecue and ending up omitting the onion since i didn t have any in the house i was able to leave it in the crock all day told hubby to open the lid 1 2 hour before i got home and just enough of the sauce evaporated so the shredding chicken was thick with sauce incredible we had it on whole wheat tortillas with a sprinkling of shredded cheese mmmmmmmmmmm kree,432
127446,157413,5,in just a day and a half i have had all three of my neighbors who tasted this cobbler jam phone and say it is to die for i really really love it you cooinmama,158
46687,1260022,4,i just this with a few modifications to meet my taste i measured by 1 3 cups because i only had about a cup of nuts i added 2 3 cup sugar and 1 3 cup brown sugar to 1 3 cup water and added 1 tbs salted butter when they came out of the oven i lightly salted them while they were still sticky as i enjoy salty sweet things for helping me something,345
420398,2375011,4,you soooo much for this had i had this 15 years ago perhaps my former husband and i wouldn t have gotten divorced i always knew how to fill up the ice cube trays but he didn t poor soul if i could have shared this with him perhaps it would have led to much less marital strife c est la vie,289
188332,512681,5,my whole family absolutely loves this meal and that in itself is a miracle i add some fresh diced tomatoes from our garden if we have them i also add an extra slice of cheese in each pocket for my cheese lovers some of my clan likes to add sour cream at the table it has been a hit every time i have it,302
28011,1616145,5,me and my dad were thinkin about what to for dinner we just bought some steaks to fry up with some sweet peppers and onions and we were debating on what to use to season it and i wanted something with a bold but sweet flavor not a steak season i found this and it is a verry recipie and its not real tangy you verry much it for a adition to the dinner,351
42532,224738,5,this dish is wonderful i added some ham i had leftover and a little chopped onion to i received many requests for this you yooper,129
220,351687,4,i this wonderful bread this afternoon and it is the bomb i like it just the way it is for the i ll be making several and putting them in the freezer,148
14670,2001670174,5,o my goodness i couldn t stop eating,36
226523,713116,3,this was okay for us the flavor was and i love the addition of chicken stock to add some depth as well i love sausage cheese grits as well as shrimp and grits so i was intrigued by the addition of the veggies dh and i are both grits purists though so for us this was just too much stuff in them after trying them we added some grated colby jack cheese and that helped but the spinach was a bit much,398
306773,215228,5,very way to prepare plantains warning poke holes in the plantains similar to a baking potato they can explode if you don t poke some holes in the skin lesson learned the hard way 0 tastes though especially if you add butter and brown sugar although butter and a sprinkle of salt is too,285
101876,225722,5,quick and my 3 yr old even helped i think it would still be with less sugar too,79
161353,293490,4,very but doesn t need all the fat content the rice is quite without the butter as the sauce mixes with it really well added some jalepno pepper to give it a bite and also added yellow and green peppers for a better colour presentation and added flavor will again with less fat content,284
79116,60650,5,this is a really dip it is anytime for any occasion took this to the fremont ohio elks cocktail party on dec 19th 2010 i added horse radish to give it a little more zip i also added sriracha sauce about 1 teaspoon and 2 teaspoons horse radish,242
12684,646279,5,i needed an that didn t need to be kept hot or cold so when i was really excited when i came across it i it exactly according to the except used fat free feta and was probably a little short on how much feta i had on hand it was so i the couscous thenight before and then just threw the rest together it sat for over an hour at room temperature and was perfect because the flavors had a chance to marry and being at room temp really the flavors stand out this is going to become a go to for potlucks or get togethers where i need an side,537
33352,1153916,5,these pork chops were so juicy and tender i will definately again,65
95238,563782,4,i used only pork loin and added 1 2 cup of kc masterpiece the second time for a really bbq,90
51399,1361337,5,wow incredibly it tastes fantastic even without meat i have a feeling i will be making this very frequently for sharing,119
243339,135872,5,love this i ve done it with all barley half and half as written and trying it tomorrow with barley and quinoa and much more budget friendly besides being ok for gluten intolerants,179
217031,445199,5,these turned out the muffins were dense but cakey the yielded 15 large muffins for me and healthy,97
182006,268973,5,wow this was so the taste reminded me of the breakfast burritos at mcdonalds which i love i will definitely be making this again you,132
100927,129992,5,marg these are so i doubled the thinking to give some as presents well there s not enough left to give away now i added a few drops of red coloring to the cookie dough too and i have the prettiest little pink cookie you ever saw they just melt in your mouth and the peppermint flavor is so refreshing and not overpowering at all mmmm these will be a regular part of my christmas baking from now on and probably throughout the year marg for a,441
102617,35093,5,this is the only slaw that i will have from now one i believe the oly change was that i grated me cabbage a little finer than i see in the pictures for posting,159
33113,770595,5,wow it tasted just like the restaurant,38
157075,60486,3,was ok i sliced the beets carrots smaller than suggested but it still took about 1hr 30min to cook the flavoring was,116
279060,671663,5,this was excellent i went with the refigerated dough and added spinach and a bit of shredded cheese to the top i did have to sub half and half for the milk and asiago for the shredded parmigiano reggiano cheese pregnant and not feeling a trip to the store but it worked out you for the,285
252449,2001666661,1,this banana bread was horrible horrible i say disgusting all i did was try and some banana bread ended up being garbage bread 10 10 do not recommend do not do this to yourself it tastes like burnt toast not even moist what a disgrace to banana breads,250
104528,144645,5,i just this soup for our thanksgiving starter 06 i followed exactly but used half half instead of cream it was plenty creamy enough the relish is excellent it sounded so strange that i considered leaving it out i served it on the side letting the guests add their own i would recommend doubling the relish it is on its own a dollop of creme fraiche was a classy addition too,374
181122,846311,5,i was looking for a to use more of my basil i did substitute a couple of items from the i used a 1 2 cup of miracle whip a 1 2 cup of sour cream instead of mayo i didn t have any ranch dressing so used honey dijon salad dressing instead also still used a small amount of mustard i also pulled a few spring onions from the garden chopped both the white greens from about 5 6 this is a keeper,390
113299,57787,5,wow roxygirl this is a real winner i d give it more than 5 stars if i could to quick to bake fun and to eat presentation too i used non stick mini muffin pans that i sprayed lightly with cooking spray and they came out easily,225
63689,304290,5,these were for our football party i don t typically like sloppy joes but i them for my husband everyone loved them i tripled the for the party and added a few dashes of crushed red pepper i also added some garlic and red green pepper to the mix it was,251
135350,2000274632,5,this was i added onion and used panko in place of breadcrumbs yum,65
66054,323328,3,i hate to be the dissenting voice here but this didn t work at all for me i it on a day that i worked from home so that it wouldn t cook too long after 7 hours my potatoes were still pretty crunchy i cooked until they were done but even then we found these to be lacking in something for us,290
127262,491466,4,we did the turkish marinade everyone loved it,45
412465,651269,5,these were so next time i will fill up the cakes more though,60
17875,29613,4,i a different beef bourguignon for my dad s birthday every year i had no leftovers with this one for putting it on here,119
12295,2002108150,5,cookie it is like a cherry wrapped in a sugar cookie,52
28861,55441,5,we loved this salad and quick to i particularly liked the cream of mushroom soup in it it s a change i am sure i will be makig this again,137
90674,934416,5,wonderful the flour lumps in the mixture so i mixed everything with my little hand mixer and that did the trick and it mixed the cinnamon very well too so it didn t float on top,177
306803,1968787,5,just like the best white clam pizza we ate in northern italy around venice,74
145346,1269562,5,you can really taste the eggnog everyone loved it,49
33671,277472,5,the best whole chicken we ve tried,34
31167,731979,5,i was a little worried when i took it out because the bread was crusty on top but once it was flipped it was perfect it smells like apple pie while cooking no syrup needed i also used granny smith apples and it was to easily flip the dish put a cookie tray on top of the casserole dish and then flip it,302
75152,19540,5,i have a lot of recipes for white clam sauce each one wonderful but this is really innovative and the lime juice is what makes it special i served this over linguine and everybody loved it,188
83203,534142,4,really very i ended up marinating overnight due to the fact no one was hungry that night will this again had steamed rice and broccoli with it and the sauce was wonderful with both had leftovers the next day and still just as you,229
293859,779652,5,i the same thing now and then i use a kitchenaid stainless steel grill pan over a screamin hot fire for just a couple of minutes on each side for medium rare comes out perfectly every time the pan was expensive 100 but worth every dime cleans up just fine in the dishwasher sometimes i marinate the steak usually filet mignon sometimes delmonico but usually just olive oil spray sea salt and black pepper that s almost impossible to ruin,437
87223,278184,4,couldnt tell a difference from other crock pot roast i had but still just expected something different,102
59489,99316,5,loved this it is too funny slathering this all over your hair and face my skin feels and my hair is very soft you you you,121
232518,156526,5,this was the hit last night at our nye dinner the top wasn t pretty but it up for it in taste for oven cleaning purposes i would wrap the bottom of the pan with foil as mine leaked a little bit during baking the baking time after foiling the top ended up at 37 minutes so a total bake time of about an hour topped each slice with some whipped cream and everyone left the table happy for posting,394
32734,40135,5,the first time i them i used cheddar and my 5 year old raves about these i have also these with blueberries also next time i these i plan on making the bacon with cheese though you,180
11266,1800045556,5,tried this brine with a 14lb whole sirloin brined for 36 hrs and used a light rub cooked it on a green mountain pellet grill at 190 for 8hrs 150 internal juicy and the flavor was incredible,189
41426,95562,5,in a word phenomenal if i could give it 10 stars i would i this christmas eve it was a huge hit,95
64905,653553,5,this is flavour and very and quick to the only modification was replacing the peas with fresh green beans loved it,114
32743,94126,5,these were wonderful they d be for dessert very cakelike and full of chocolate flavor i m going to try making them with fresh raspberries the next time again dancer for another winning,184
108364,453315,5,you so much for a wonderful i follow the exactly not too spicy at all it s actually mild for me and perfect for our two little girls whenever i want to spice it up i just add a bit of cayenne i about 5lbs worth of drummettes for my nephew s birthday party and everyone gobbled them up within minutes again,305
453651,2267421,4,not but it is edible with some butter or cream cheese the flavor is greatly improved one would be challenged to find a low carb bread that is easier doesn 039 t have strange ingredients and doesn 039 t taste eggy,212
16294,292436,4,this was a freakish but idea for my sons halloween party this past october he s a 6 years old boy who tells me to tell you these pizzas were the whole class loved them i did dice up some pepperoni and added that before the cheese all and all this is just a cheap super i also want to add that the serving size is perfect for appetizers or just for kids for making my job a little easier,386
113882,273097,5,outstanding my children absolutely loved the ham and insisted on using some of the glaze as a dipping sauce it for an enjoyable christmas dinner a bunch,152
49890,345731,5,very reminded me of twix bars too bonus that it s to i melt the chips on a low setting in the microwave i don t have a double boiler then i spread it on top of the cooled caramel for the just came back to add another star i don t know why i only gave it 4 these are,265
27935,716192,5,these were really i drizzled them with a little bit of melted butter about halfway through cooking something i saw suggested on a few other recipes there were not any nuggets left after dinner i used the new quick release foil on my cookie sheet and it worked out the nuggets didn t stick at all and the breading stayed on rather than sticking to the pan i served these with 15996 and 916 for dessert,400
67954,195423,5,dancer this is wonderful i it for dinner tonight and it was perfect wouldn t change a thing the sauce was very mild yet very flavorful and went with the tillapia,161
254063,2872161,5,i just this tonight because i did not have yeast to my usual crust i used all purpose flour and i was reluctant if it was going to be any but it turned out really i got thumbs up from my picky kids will definately this again sometime,233
37781,602849,5,this hit the spot i was looking for something to do with my close to being bad mushrooms and am so glad i happened upon this yum,128

48588,1470681,4,this was and cheap but it didn t wow me if you know what i mean we re vegan so we used smart balance also i used purple cabbage which it look beautiful and i used fettuccine noodles broken into thirds instead of egg noodles my 2 yr old loved it and i will it again,264
18646,588529,4,yum i used 9 chicken breasts 2lbs i think so i 1 5x the sauce i took the advice of the other commenters and cut back the sugar by 1 4 cup using 1 1 4 cups unfortunately i think the full sweetness would have been perfect next time i ll it full strength also added 1 2 tsp minced garlic 1 clove and a dash of chili flakes and would use even more chili flakes again next time there will certainly be a next time,408
82594,196320,5,everyone in my family loved this coffee cake it came out very moist and i froze half of the coffee cake for another time very and,129

51983,79772,5,and creamy dip i did not use the raw onion but it was still i did not have any dill can t wait to try with fresh dill and oregano,129
5170,2000208679,2,i dont know if i did something wrong but it was waaay to watery i had to add more flour 9 pancakes turned into alot more,120
104592,397176,5,dish for a supper party most of the items are things you would probably have in the fridge or store cupboard but there are some things could be improvised without spoiling the overall effect i tried it the second time with sun dried tomatoes and it gave a more dense tomato flavour a family favourite,300
155186,2001638510,5,perfect the way it is but loved the idea someone said to add jalape ntilde os too personal preference we left out the olives this is perfect for a weeknight meal for 4 or a weekend dish for 2 to graze on for 2 days,214
64409,352538,4,this was very and quite i it exactly as described in the but next time i think i will add some red pepper flakes and a bit of salt for some excitement for posting,162
107972,85528,5,and i a few slight changes with what i had on hand i used 1 4 c finely chopped onion added a little of my fresh rosemary and i didn t have any herbed croutons so i used a cup of herbed bread crumbs for the cheese mixture i also sprinkled some cherry tomotoes on top while it bake and added just a little more shredded cheese it turned out,338
44214,861857,5,fabulous flavour tender juicy texture and oh the gravy i the garlic mashed potatoes the day before and saved the cooking water from the potatoes and added it to the gravy heated the potatoes in the casserole dish in the oven with the roast for the last 30 minutes also served with dilled butter carrots and brussel sprouts my guests raved about the feast for posting,366
110925,56829,5,my husband and i really enjoyed this dish i didn t have any fresh herbs so i used pesto that seem to be the kicker you and i will use this over and over,152
276903,998226,5,excellent flavor for sharing super and so much easier than browning first saves on the mess it did take longer half way in i moved my setting to hight was moist and very tender,176
243518,528076,5,it is so handy having this on hand in the cupboard,50
50022,592131,5,okay this is the most incredible banana bread i ve ever had do i have to share i replaced the chocolate chips i m not a fan with chopped walnuts and it s just incredible,169

121490,43413,5,loved it and so did the dh i m going to try the blueberry version today,71
74263,246616,5,soup i didn t have vegetable stock so i used chicken stock,58
168287,269575,5,very very similar to the tomato and lamb rice that my in laws i added some tomato paste along with the tomatoes to the tomato flavor stronger to get the rice really i first brought the rice and mixture to a boil on high heat then turned it on low heat and simmered for the 20 minutes then i took the pot off the heat and put tea towel under the cover and left it for 30 minutes,377
71659,56002,5,love this relish i ve been making it for years i use the shredding disc on the processor for the zucchini but chop the onions and peppers by hand to give it more contrast also i don t bother with the water bath hasn t hurt us yet for posting,241
53491,244817,5,this dip is really wonderful i happen to like my dip with a little more spices so i doubled the spices called for for sharring i had this with warm french bread and spaghetti,174
172651,549544,5,this is so i had some black olives left from another i added them it was okay but the original was better,105

329214,824336,5,these are the best gluten free cookies i ve attempted and i ve tried a lot i used guar gum instead of xanthan it s all i had i also refrigerated the dough for a while before baking to firm it up a bit baked for 10 min instead of 12 and they were pretty a little flat but maybe that s because i used guar gum,307
298874,1800050891,5,i 039 m very happy i found this i only added a little salt a amount of pepper and a very amount of ground sage the only way you can tell it doesn 039 t have sausage in it is because there aren 039 t any actual pieces of meat sage is my 1 year old and i ate until we were full i can 039 t wait to this for my husband,315
133066,256768,4,very healthy and a combination of flavors the black olives go well with the other ingredients i left out the salami as a personal preference next time i will try adding some lemon juice fresh herbs and maybe green onions i used herbed goat cheese instead of feta which it a bit hard to crumble but tasted i used balsamic vinegar cider vinegar and also added a bit of extra virgin olive oil to the dressing the second time i ate it i threw in some dried cranberries and walnuts which i liked also it s to have a salad that is filling and healthy,544
26217,2001151434,3,i thought the as is was pretty boring i added 1 tbsp of brown sugar 1 tbsp ketchup 1 4 c milk 1 4 c red wine a few dashes of hot sauce and some seasoning salt i also simmered a rind of parmesan cheese with the sauce i finished it off with a few splashes of balsamic vinegar it is a base for a meaty red sauce but imo definitely needed some tweaks to take it to the next level,375
266810,115694,5,this is a to bring to any party i also used reduced fat cream cheese and light ranch dressing and it still tastes i ve also it with left over cooked and chopped chicken breasts and it taste that way as well i prefer it served with tortilla chips and celery sticks,263
120426,1678870,5,i took the advice of 1 4 cup oat bran 1 egg and saute chopped onion before adding to mixture baking using olive oil non stick spray was fine and the burgers didn t fall apart i had honey so i used that instead of molasses i also added figs and a teaspoon of crushed garlic mashing the black beans was labor intense any helpful hints,332
420398,2931302,1,i don 039 t get it can somebody please tell me the difference between these ice cubes and the ones that come out of my refrigerator door my daughter and i are making snoopy snow cones and i 039 m not sure which ones to use the directions say ice but doesn 039 t say cubed or crushed we have been waiting for hours now trying to figure out the difference and almost all the ice has melted also are these non toxic,412
32204,690173,5,i a double batch of these thinking there would be leftovers boy was i wrong these babies went quick i added a ton of halved peanut butter cups and it them soooo chocolatey and soooo peanut buttery that no one could resist this is by far the best brownie out there and the only one i ll ever again,296
148569,716408,5,this was an be sure to roll your truffles in your coating soon after rolling them into balls otherwise they start to harden and the coconut nuts or whatever else you want to coat it with won t stick they are very to,215
167348,750006,5,this turned out i used brown rice la victoria brand salsa half mild half medium and low fat cheese i served it with corn tortillas and a dollop of low fat sour cream yum next time i it i think i ll experiement by replacing the beef with some chorizo and smashed pinto or black beans just for something different and i ll add some chives and olives for zip this is a very versatile it would probably taste with chicken as well this will be put straight into my regular rotation a note to the leftovers yummier use brown rice instead of white i used the kind that steams in the bag in your microwave in about 5 minutes it just seems to hold up better i also threw a couple of heaping spoonfuls into a skillet then mixed in two eggs and scrambled the whole thing for an aweseome breakfast this morning,798
211614,526565,5,so i should have listen to you about making two chickens we picked the bird down to the bones and still wanted more the only thing that i added is a couple of hours of the bird sitting in a brine,195
23939,417915,5,i had a 3lb roast and after reading the other reviews decided to double the other ingredients hubby saw me and said just like someone else s hubby did why don t we inject some of this into it well we did we followed the other directions except i used a glass baking dish and reduced the temp 25degrees after it rested we sliced it and poured some of the extra sauce over the slices it was moist juicy and very flavorful i would describe it as tasting similar to the inside of a chinese steamed dumpling only as a thick slab of meat will definitely this again for the,566
12877,714313,5,this is better than store bought enchilada sauce and very to prepare,68
313325,58413,5,this makes a mac n cheese it s and creamy what more could you ask for and to top it off i always have these ingredients in the house,132
59197,283474,5,this soup is fantastic love the flavors as written minus the pork and mint didn t have it i will be making this alot in the future you evelyn,141
200754,364685,4,this was very i pared the down to 1 serving using a handful of tortellini and on of those tuna packets i also used a little extra vinegar since i like that more than mayo very and very in the future i might a whole and eat it for lunch for a few days adding the tomatoes at serving time but for today it was a lunch for me to eat while sitting on the porch,356
87075,2001383501,2,i ve been looking for a loose meat to satiate my quot school lunch quot craving for this midwestern sandwich i loved them as a kid and hadn t had one since i followed the exactly and i must say way too salty my tastes have changed over the years amp i ve been a chef for 15 so perhaps my palate is less inclined to consume extreme saltiness i could barely finish one i m not giving up though i ll try it again w half the salt i browned an additional pound of ground beef amp added it to the salty concoction i will update after trying this w the unseasoned meat blended in,572
97098,742029,5,this was my 9 year old asked me to put this in her book for when she s an adult,79
22176,2001400551,5,this tonite and it was fantastic add red pepper flakes 1 3 can of chicken broth and 1 2 can of alfrado sauce to the mixture for a tuscany taste glad i did,154
134281,1458727,5,these were delish i used turkey pepperoni and they turned out i will be using these instead of bacon in some recipes you for posting,132
64364,291226,4,this came out the meat was beautifully brown and fork tender the flavor is mellow sweet and rich this was a snap to too i the marinade first and put it into the crockpot then i added the chopped onion and carrots and finally i floured and browned the meat before adding it to the crockpot i used the low setting for eight hours i used chardonnay instead of dry sherry or sake i also asked the butcher at the grocery store to cut the beef ribs into two inch long pieces so they would be to serve,494
129937,223180,5,this was very and just the right amount of heat this is a hundred times better than the taco packets from the store,115
3426,181781,5,excellent this was my first attempt at bananas foster and it could not have been better or easier i did sub a few item since they were not in my pantry i used 2 tsp of banana flavoring instead of 2 tbs banana liquor gold rum instead of dark and smart balance instead of butter i can t wait to prepare this for guest janic412,324
48115,1029268,4,this is for a quick chicken and dumplings and i will use it regularly it won t replace my more involved which i love but this is perfect for getting a home cooked meal on the table fast,185
40118,40620,5,i was looking for a to use up a pound and a half of hamburger and happened upon this one i didn t have frozen hashbrowns or the canned onions but that was okay i slice three big potatoes thinly and layered them in the pan then covered with everything else as in the i bumped the temperature on the oven to 400 and i sprayed the foil i put over the top since i didn t want to cheese sticking to it an hour later i had a wonderful casserole we ate it all at that meal and everyone enjoyed it for a wonderful,505
56652,755102,5,my new favorite cookie only change was i used butter also used my small pampered chef scoop to drop cookies on sheet for posting,128
171033,1061099,2,i this with some other kind of fish that was on sale and i thought it would turn out well but the nopalitos fresh and the fish kept draining water that i kept pouring off the cilantro sauce also did not seem to go well with the dish it was edible but not fantastic if you try this i would find some way to reduce the water like drying the fish or pan frying it also add some more spice to it,391
123593,727989,4,not bad if i must says it alot of brownies and the taste was sooo chocolaty i had three myself and i m on a diet i was only going for one ahah they where addictive and i loved them but the only thing i didn t like was the frosting it was so and it tasted to sugary and i had to take it off my brownie everytime cause i didn t like it but overall for the i ll it again with regulare all ready frosting,400
50453,221139,5,the chicken version doubled the sauce to serve with rice and removed the lemon before serving perfect,101
374725,2000202734,5,one of the best egg breakfasts i ve,35
503992,2844172,3,i think this is a i myself like alot more spice but that you can add i did not have green peppers so used red and must of cut my veg too small as in the cooking process they were gone but flavor still there i will definitely use this again for my base jambalaya,261
450948,476796,3,this was a decent weeknight meal it goes together quickly without a lot of fuss however i can t quite see how a that requires measuring cups mixing utensils a baking pan and serving utensils is less messy than the usual preparation the reuben flavor is but the bisquick crust is quite thick which means there is less of an impact from the usual amount of filling if i it again i will increase the filling ingredients especially the cheese and cut smaller pieces to serve,470
73061,32638,5,i just finished making these muffins i m a big fan of bran muffins and these ae they came out of the oven full moist and perfect lennie for a breakfast treat,157

224013,1803121167,5,i this for the first time tonight i had never clam cakes before these came out perfect and i mean perfect i did change it up a little i used buttermilk instead of milk i it myself i used minced onions instead of onion flakes i also a double batch and used a whole pound of fresh clams my family was impressed my 14 year old does not eat seafood and she enjoyed them,365

78897,1359588,4,first time i this i used only the 1 can of tomato sauce and it was too dry the second time i used 2 cans and it was much moister and everyone loved it,150
80044,715651,5,this soup is amazingly delicous i found myself wanting to lick the blender i used a serrano pepper instead a habanero and believe me this soup still had plenty of heat i heeded the advice of some of the reviewers and did not use the cream and coconut milk chooing instead to blend the entire soup rather than just a third of it worked perfectly for me also i used earth balance margarine and imagine brand no chicken broth for a perfect vegan soup after tasting the roasted vegetables i was sorely tempted to eat them on the spot but i controlled myself,553
157068,1182971,5,excellent rice this is a side dish for mexican we even liked it served cold with chips,86
261020,1233796,5,i this every year for christmas many times with a mixture of different dried fruit i normally keep a container of assorted dried fruit and candied ginger soaking in rum so i don t have to wait for the fruit to macerate when i m ready to the cake it s much yummier than fruit cake we even gave slices of this cake as a wedding favor at our wedding,346

3954,313152,4,i m 13 i did this with my twin the first second batches we overcooked it but the 3rd 4th the 5th batches they turned out nicely even if you overcooked it they are still we added about 1 2 teaspoon more of vanilla they re really to for me my twin the taste were ok they re not really our type my parents said they re a bit too sweet so you might want to reduce the sugar i offered the cookies to my cousins they went crazy over them my little believe me cousin who is 5 named tasya ate 3 jumbo ones non stop tasya is a die hard fan of strawberries she said these cookies are way much better than strawberries and when her sister wanted to have a bite she flew her hand away and said no loudly so i gave her sister one after a bite she immediately said mmmm the same thing happened to her other sister next i offered these cookies to my little cousin who is a boy named adam he s 6 adam went crazy over them he asked called cried for more wow they must have been really like the cookies we ll be making more for them thanx for the tonkcats,1037

226914,2000777578,4,idea i pico de gallo and put the scrambled egg pico de gallo bacon cheese and rolled them up this is a keeper and had plenty of flavor,134
67064,582318,3,i this yesterday for a garden club meeting and although its a beautiful salad it was rather bland tasting and i even doubled the dressing maybe it would be better with an italian dressing or with garlic chives instead of regular chives,235
71109,2883134,3,this tasted quite but the consistency was closer to a very large muffin than to a cobbler i will use this again for brunch muffins but not for cobbler kinda 039 disappointed,173
108105,347233,5,this is so i love the flavour and the peas just it so fresh and love love love,78
558,54067,5,perfect so very rich and cheesy since my husband thinks a meal is incomplete without some sort of meat i added about 1 cup of sliced german sausage and it gave this just the right amount of spiciness without too much meat,221
345363,589653,5,fantastic bread i have several loaves and absolutely love it to it a bit more healthy i use 2 cups bread flour 1 cup whole wheat flour and add 2 teaspoons of wheat gluten and only 2 teaspoons of sugar i do the whole thing in the bread machine perfect toast for the morning no more store bought english muffins in our house,322
135297,465121,5,very i did not have any parsley and i added white wine served it over rice with a green salad you,97
105812,37584,4,these were i think that they would be better with more spices added and maybe some spiced syrup to go on top i mine with the molasses option and i halved the i ended up with 8 decent sized pancakes i used walnuts instead of pecans as this is what i had on hand definitely think they would be better with the pecans i used 6 tbsp applesauce instead of the eggs and pumpkin silk nog to it more festive i would these again for posting,431
72990,60362,5,the smell throughout the house while this was cooking was to die for we couldn t wait for it to be dinner time the only change i ll next time is to use boneless skinless breasts i can t wait to try it again,206

260516,369558,5,lainey this salad was fantastic just like mcd s salad i didn t use the fat free where indicated only because i had the regular cheddar cheese ranch and sour cream i love salads so this is going to be my new lunch for awhile for posting,235
359030,1794031,5,really dip i used lowfat cream cheese to lighten it up i put in extra olives and used brine from garlic stuffed olives also chopped some of those up as well i will this again maybe use a bit of white pepper next time really very with pretzels,242
176432,609262,5,i love this salad i used apple cider vinegar and it was really i also candied the walnuts which really added a surprising taste for the dressing,144

174883,65634,5,everytime i this i m asked for the it s that even when i ve not put in the parsley or peppers it s been wonderful i only use 1t sugar this is a dish to take for potluck sugarmegnolia,182
304161,1931826,5,excellent used russets since i had them and water instead of the chicken broth since i had none still very and refreshing tossed in a little lemongrass with the chopped basil too,178
16438,31261,5,imaginative and hilarious you mirjam unhappy ants are liable to go sour before processing i don t know where or how you got this but this is,140
51230,226294,5,for and flavorful i it exactly as posted no quot just added a bit more of this quot or quot substituted that quot the is perfect as is so much,142
5049,2774414,5,these cookies are i replaced the cocoa with a box of instant chocolate pudding mix the dough was a bit thick so i had to add a bit of milk honestly i don 039 t think they 039 ll last until tomorrow,197
169177,147334,3,we really enjoyed this but thought it was a little bit too sweet would benefit from the addition of a little cayenne pepper for balance will definitely again looneytunesfan,172
26820,409415,5,we loved this i actually it for friends that came over for game night served with a tossed salad didn t enough noted i used cheese ravioli and added fresh basil from the garden to a jar of marinara sauce big hit sue l i love and,228
153412,1473788,5,absolutely fabulous my sister this cake and it was so moist and that i it again the very same week i just had to have more i the into cupcakes for a potluck and they were at hit perfect lemon flavor,198
103077,164459,3,these taste but i couldn t get the ganache to firm up enough at room temperature so they might not be stable enough to give as gifts,132
19164,31232,3,this was very i used a mixture of medium cheddar and monterey jack cheese,73
15725,1762460,5,i also like to hunt and most of my deer meat ends up as jerky i have tried about six different recipes and this is the first one i will keep and again my friends all like it to a few people said i could add black pepper to it before drying it but i liked it just the way it tasted and that was,293
51721,521337,5,yummi i can see what you mean about lots of pepper i finished all my black pepper and had to use white i didn t use onions though as i didn t have time to chill it for as along as i d have liked to and didn t want a very onion y tasting salad very for posting,259
156060,2742686,5,the only change i to this excellent was to add 1 more jalapeno 1 teaspoon garam masala and then to let it age for a full month everyone loves this chutney,154
89204,345702,5,this is a perfect crock pot and an even bigger bonus my kids love it you so much jen on a side note i use greek yogurt instead of cream cheese to lighten it up a tad just as,173
295188,572672,4,this was really i did not have any pimentos but i am sure they would have been fantastic in this i also used red wine vinegar instead of the white because i didnt have any for posting this,188
402149,1800168746,4,i have this soup many many times and it 039 s always a hit even with my picky child re heated the next day too and packed with stuff don 039 t forget the corn bread,164
26297,12129,4,very my family really enjoyed this last night i loved the sauce on the noodles the chops came out very tender and moist,119
49892,587766,5,this was very i with chicken instead of shrimp it came out so one thing i did change was to use canned artichoke hearts in water instead of oil to cut down on the fat,166
13546,2002679070,5,the pizza really turn out and was very to highly suggest this and add your own twist to the seasonings if you d like,116
20574,57162,5,very it takes some time but well worth it i think i may add more tomatillos next time i like a little more tang very,116
258292,814629,4,i thought this was a pretty smoothie the flavor combination goes well together but banana is definitely the dominant flavor when i this again i will probably reduce the amount of bananas i put in since it is november i had to use frozen strawberries i would love to try this with fresh as i imagine they would taste a lot better than the frozen for the for my 3 chefs 2009,372
146859,1950859,5,these were deslicious even though they were a bit tedious to it was well worth it,81
59120,355694,4,you for giving us this wonderful it was something unique without being difficult to i had everthing on hand and didn t have to buy anything i don t normally have in my pantry loved it freebie,191
54305,48107,2,i don t know if i did something wrong or what but this simply did not work for us the stuffing was burned and came out like a brick because the cheese was baked into it the chicken itself was but we found the results of the rest of it basically inedible sorry,259
126371,784046,4,superfast and supereasy but i cooked mine too long and they weren t very gooey will take them out sooner next time i also the for 1 6 servings to use one egg and just 2 ramekins for my partner and i,198
80746,601227,5,this is by far the best out there tastes like the egg drop i ve had in restaurants even better than some don t understand why there are not many many reviews come on people you gotta this super alan,198
288249,1347760,4,i was looking for a quick that didn t include any butter and these were i used mini chocolate chips and regular flour i think next time i will use less baking soda as they were more muffin texture than i wanted i will definately these again with a different add in for the,272
139743,136558,4,balance of fruit spice not too sweet fiber rich would be with a shot of brandy or rum who could ask for more when i cooked the mixture it seemed too dry so i added back the stock from the stew beef the pie baked up just fine i doubled the receipe and that gave me enough for three 9 in pies,290
153343,1113244,5,i added about 1 2 cup of cream and my cake was and moist my only complaint 1 cup of oreos is way to little next time i ll add more,130
120106,198417,5,low carb that has comfort taste is hard to find but this is a winner can t believe someone would think of mixing all these varied ingredients but the combination sure is and keep em comin,187
65363,1802493899,3,the cake tasted pretty considering some parts did not come out properly the cake part itself did not work well for me i think i should have spent more time getting the flour smoother when mixed in w egg yolk and sugar but because i was trying to be careful with it it ended up lumpy even after folding in egg whites because it was lumpy when i put in the pans i decided to,372
49506,293016,5,and so to what a i will these again and again,45
10125,5076,5,dawn this was superb i it for deepavali but already the children can t get their hands off it selvi,99
148058,980012,5,this rocks it for my lunch today the rest of the family does not share my love of thai and can not wait to have it again tom i did not have all the ingredients so i can only imagine how it would be with everything,213
12965,21295,5,excellent real taste,20
17045,9225,4,this was and i upped the cream cheese to 4 oz and did not drain the juice from the canned corn the casserole was and moist i let the kids crush the chips before opening the bag wow did they like that the lettuce tomato onion and sour cream toppings really the dish complete,273
166578,2000231865,5,i used green onion instead only because thats what was handy i also added a bit of garlic then mixed in some rotini and topped with mozzarella and shredded parm i uploaded a picture husband and 3yr old loved it,210
8972,1803541241,5,can anyone help me with adjustments for high altitude on this i am at over 6000 feet my mother in law has been making this for christmas for years and we all love it the past few years we have been in colorado and she has not any adjustments for elevation and the cake has not been turning out well this year she passed the torch to me as i am a more experienced baker but i am not with cakes and would love some help in advance,428
248715,1050605,5,have with a beef stew and you ve got a complete meal very daved it to my favorites,82
28091,629692,5,super and moist with a cake like consistancy everybody loves this and its not bad for you we ve it a few times and it turned out every time,139
202343,2000094247,5,i love this very and very authentic i also love the way my palestinian american friends do it those ladies are extremely cook some of them add some parsley and mint leaves to their humus,186
442328,2002147538,5,i loved this drink so refreshing,32
30081,350854,5,these were surprisingly i was upset when my husband ate the left overs i added feta cheese and we ate these open faced that means i piled the ingredients on to the plate and put the pita on the side i also toasted the pita in a toaster over as suggested by another reviewer i added about 1 tsp of lemon juice to the sauce i ll this again,337
68613,945248,5,what s not to love about this chicken i sprayed with cooking spray instead of using the butter to cut down on the fat but we loved it just the same,147
42316,638072,2,i just really dont like the soy sauce flavor when we ate the steak it was all i could taste this would be a better marinade for pork the best marinade i have ever found for flank steaks is adolf s meat marinade its comes as a powder in a packet and all you add is water you will die its so,289
56366,345234,5,wow this was so used everything but the split peas because i didn t have them on hand i also added some beef bouillon granules and extra water towards the end and it really kicked up the flavor i also used seashells instead of elbows everyone loved it especially hubby,268
70018,752454,5,i really liked these i them as mini muffins for my daughters school and they worked really well next time i will double the amount of rasins some of the mini muffins didn t have any in them for the muffins,205
30138,448204,5,i these for my kids and they me too loved them what i did was mix some cool whip in with the cream cheese until it was smooth then the i set up a mini buffet of the graham crackers cool whip cream cheese mix and thinly sliced strawberries the kids assembled their own dessert and had so much fun i ll use this for parties in the future so much for sharing this budget friendly and,380
242638,742372,5,my family loved these i m not a huge fan of rice flour so i changed it to 1 2 c rice flour 1 2 c almond flour 1 2 c sorghum flour and 1 2 c quinoa flour was a little thrown off by the gooey texture at first but then read the part that said to refrigerate the dough for an hour they turned out fabulous you for sharing,317
391407,1559406,5,use stout in the and serve a bottle with the chili double the quantity works well too,85
200296,311193,5,and my dh and dd fought over the leftovers neither of them are to please so this for a family meal a keeper kittencal for another one,133
399533,708991,5,absolutely the best bread ever i have already this twice with rave reviews and am so excited to have found this i followed the exactly except that i put in more cherries a jar and a half and it was so very,205
108620,190230,4,these were i used freshly roasted pumkin puree and doubled the sugar i halved the and still had quite a few left over i don t have a belgian waffle iron so i got a bunch of little waffles to freeze the only problem was that my son didn t like them and he s the reason i them i think that the spice was a bit much for him since i have a stronger spice mix than the usual kind it has cardamom and more cloves and ginger than the others i have tried also i don t know if it was my iron or the but these let of alot of steam and the waffles didn t crisp that well next time i them i will quarter the and add less spice you for a healthy waffle,639
58189,363962,5,very my family wanted dessert tonight so i chose this because it sounded quick and and this was very to after it cooled down i used store bought cream cheese frosting to frost it my family was very happy you chia,212
132313,198417,1,sorry but this wasn t worth the time or ingredients we didn t even eat it all,77
15828,257146,5,these were and,14
46044,85409,5,this was very i was leary because my family won t hardley eat anything that doesnt have meat they ate the entire thing ginny will again,135
22083,2449992,5,this is a very it comes out as is or sometimes i add sugar or honey to it a little sweeter,90
82959,168255,5,fabulous it tastes even better than it looks i this for halloween and everyone loved it the only change i was to use a little more beef since we re a bunch of carnivores,169
106251,272300,5,we love cauliflower as it is but this was superb and the rosemary and garlic was a wonderful addition however i guess i needed a larger head of cauliflower because the salt was a little much it is definitely a keeper for sure,225
65922,185142,5,i used 1 cup flour and 1 2 cup of cornmeal because i didn t have the corn muffin mix this may have been too much because then i needed 1 2 cup of milk it came out flavorful and moist,182
29679,1028382,5,these are pretty quick and to put together and taste phenomenal i used 3 cups of powdered sugar and it was just right will have to stop myself from making these again any time soon or i will eat them all used semi sweet as the store was out of milk chocolate might keep it that way as they were really,301
53853,320775,4,these taste just like a pbj sandwich taste but the muffin was a little dense,76
84612,334668,5,i have never tiramisu and wanted to try boy it was terrific i followed the except for the cocoa topping for which i used a microplane to grate 70 dark chocolate over the top i found that i didn t use all of the lady fingers or the coffee it came out just perfect and really melts in your mouth i have always ordered this in restaurants and didn t realize that raw eggs were used and no cooking that concerned me a little but there were no ill effects and everyone loved it it is better than any i have had while eating out highly recommended,541
403134,572672,4,i think i messed these up because i thought they looked done about 10 minutes before they were supposed to be so i took them out maybe my oven is just different because the top was golden brown almost too brown but after they cooled and i cut them they werent done on the inside but they taste wonderful i will maybe turn the oven temp down next time and see how that does,372
469146,838356,5,this is basically a cornbread with squash and it does taste really my children do not like any veggies and they ate this without too much insistence which says much they didn 039 t love it but they didn 039 t hate it either which is progress toward expanding their palates for sharing the,288
110071,1466341,4,way to use up the glut of kale we have right now i don t know how much a bunch usually is so i used one pound it was way too oily with 3 tbsp oil and not quite as salty as i would like with 1 tsp salt but i like things salty will try to cut the oil a bit next time oh and if you use different kinds of kale expect different cooking times the delicate redbor was burnt to a crisp by the time the more robust vates was still chewy so separate varieties,450
12026,228392,5,i just these this morning for christmas and used half chocolate chips and half of the swirled red and green white chocolate chips wonderful cookies this will definitely be my go to from now on,192
43850,324281,5,this is the only way that i ever want to pumpkin seeds from now on except i may try a sweet version next time i loved these kryssy,130
96346,630268,5,my hubsand and kids loved it reminded me of spaghetti o s both smell and taste and i was turned off,99
96815,79250,5,we used to call this gipsy toast strangely where i grew up my sikh neighbours were very fond of this,100
72011,454149,5,i loved this and my husband liked it which is saying something because he doesn t ususally care for soy sauce i used a little extra chicken broth and left out the red hot pepper flakes it would be too spicey for us i ve this twice now and plan to it again for a,261
18872,1113089,5,love this we don t keep sherry or wine in the house so i add sprite or 7 up instead,83
9326,1802442150,4,i added a little bit more milk and butter decreased the amount of chocolate chips added cinnamon and sprinkled a little bit of raw sugar on top the muffins came out perfectly moist but the chocolate chips sunk to the bottom next time i 039 ll put the chocolate chips in after 10 min in the oven i might also try adding some banana and nutmeg,341
123696,366048,5,i watch a british soap called coronation street they always order hot pots them sound so well if this is what they re eating then it is i don t want to think of it yet but this would be really on a cold canadian winter s night will again then served with fresh carrots as suggested true comfort,294
43834,219865,4,we always this for get together we like to smother it with shredded cheese on the top too,89
38953,291650,5,perfect added some lemon juice to the batter as suggested by other reviews will be making too often,99
194586,727740,4,makes leftovers it was enough for two dinners and two lunches for both me and my husband,88
25587,535136,5,damn that was when i heard everyone say how it was i thought yeah right that was so so so i cooked this my girlfriend and her parents it went down a storm,154
25723,362184,5,and for sharing,15
425478,293924,4,thoughts on this cookie after making them the dough was all crumbs after i mixed it until i took a handful at a time and kneaded it together into a ball it was rather dry and stiff it might need another egg after chilling it was very stiff and hard to work i used a tablespoon sized cookie scoop to scoop out the dough then rolled it between my hands to warm it to get it soft after it was a smooth ball i flattened it between my hands they cooked for 12 min at 400 degrees they looked like molasses crinkles cracked on the top they did spread i had about 15 to a sheet the yield was 80 cookies or 6 5 dozen next time i might use melted butter and not chill the dough apparently they are supposed to be rolled out thin and cut like gingerbread men but with the way this is that wasn t going to happen hand rolling them was the only way i cold do it oh and while the dough was a bit spicy the end cookie was more mellow in taste,927
41842,457390,5,que beleza right on just like mom used to super deliciosa,57
81045,1410992,5,this was so i used the full fat organic yogurt and after chopping up the cucumber i sure to grate a little extra into the sauce and followed the rest of the as put 5 stars shaye,177
102976,60071,5,this was a i used it several times over the holidays and it was a hit i even them vegetarian without the bacon for friends who are vegetarians,142
55251,1193707,4,my husband and sister in law liked the cake i used canned almond paste not marzipan maybe that makes all the difference the reason why i didn t like it much,156
44289,115098,4,this was and i will it again however i did not add the ground sausage or mushrooms because of picky kids i also added more sauce than it called for about a 1 2 c more for a,172
155116,694899,4,so to whip up will again,24
50338,2685343,5,loved it so to yet so,21
102201,221734,5,5 stars for ease quickness and having leftovers you can also drizzle this with balsamic vinegar putting the fish on lemon slices or on fresh spinach is too the balsamic vinegar drizzles down and it s,199
3470,142200,5,absolutely my entire family loved this one i ll be making it often,66
63017,607266,5,i have been looking for a similar to the potato salad sold in our local deli in illinois and this is the closest i ve come across very,134
20528,1040109,5,these are so and i always have the ingredients in my pantry which means i will probably gain 10 pounds i only baked them 18 minutes and they were perfect these little muffins packed a pecan pie flavor in them i can t wait to share them with my friends tomorrow if i don t eat them all first,290
223561,357987,5,i m such a sneaky mom baked a butternut squash in the microwave for dinner one night just seasoned with butter salt pepper dh wouldn t touch it and dd 3 said it was yucky the next night i took the other half and it into this i loved eating dinner with my family that night the 3 year old was telling her dad and i that she just didn t like that squash last night as she chowed down on her pasta she loved it and asked for seconds even dh ate leftovers the next day he officially gave it 3 5 stars after all it is squash but eating leftovers says it all for me since it was already cooked i skipped the initial roasting step but did roast some garlic before sticking it in the processor served with mostoccolli crusty bread and a salad for helping me bring a new veg into our rotation,783
123402,197456,5,i so wish i could give this more then 5 stars dh was drooling as it was cooking because it smelled so i substituted the marjoam and thyme for basil and oregano what i had on hand and i used whole wheat bread crumbs for the bread cubes i also decreased the cheddar cheese to one cup personal preference and added a sprinkling of fresh parmesan cheese i honestly think it could be done without the cheese and still be i served it with a grilled veggie lasagna this cassarole totally stole the show no leftovers the lasagna still sits in my fridge lol next time i will it with the stated spices for a dish,602
107047,147107,4,this was really but be warned these are very filling i had two and felt stuffed i sauteed my chicken pieces with onions garlic and cajun seasoning before adding the soup and i placed them in a greased 9x13 pan and covered it tightly with foil and put them in a 350 oven for about 15 min which i will again,305
35813,106608,5,these cookies taste i did add a few dashes of cinnamon and some walnuts i ll be keeping this as our oatmeal cookie from now on,126
12199,174090,5,i really like the tart sweet flavor of the cranberries in these bars i used frozen and they worked just fine i topped with powdered sugar and they look as as they taste i ll use more nuts next time this is a holiday treat,221
171264,575059,4,i precooked my sliced unpeeled potatoes with skins in microwave on my potatoe setting even though i had then sliced in a dish with 1 4 cup of water undercooked potatoes in my home don t go over well i doubled the butter for the bottom because i know it is not healthier but because it adds moister to potatoes and i didn t want this dish to be dry i sliced my onions with my p c slicer getting the onions bare thin which i believe had a impact on the success of the dish i use venison beef bologna i also added a beefed up fresh ground pepper to dish i was very impressed at quickness ease with kids helping and then the taste i put on a dollap of sour cream on my serving 5 stars,680
137197,297692,5,what a fabulous marinade this is i had already another salsa so i didn t actually use that part of this but the marinade alone is worthy of 5 stars i didn t slice the chicken just marinated boneless skinless breast whole for about the same time suggested and barbecue d them this is a new favourite at my house,310
240390,1821704,5,hubby and mil loved these said they tasted like pasta with a garlic and butter sauce i cooked them in the oven because we weren t grilling will these again next time we grill,174
163665,2100948,5,found this looking for a quick and way to use garam masala it has quickly become my new weeknight go to meal dh and i were never fond of tomatoes but they are our new favorite fruit because of this i used canned whole tomatoes and use the processor to chop them finely as we do not like large chunks i use nearly double the amount of tomatoes called for and substitute juice from the can for the water i also use an extra half teaspoon of garam masala because we love it so i naan bread perfect for sopping up the sauce saffron rice or potato samosas to go with this dish,571
377186,345915,5,very i mine in the bread maker on dough setting i put extra garlic powder in with it i spread it out and put sauce on it and cooked it for 12 minutes without toppings then i put the toppings on and cooked it for another 10 minutes that way the crust is done and the toppings are not burnt love home pizza for sharing,316
173691,462183,5,i these last night very to put together used that same rising method mentioned in aug 15th comment i placed a shallow pan filled with hot water directly under the pan i didnt put it in the oven gave the dough a rise before baking i melted instead of softened the margarine for the filling boy was that a mess but easily fixable i also blended the filling instead of sprinkling in layers i will do those methods next time the end result was fabulous the dough was soft and moist and the whole thing was and gooey and sinful just how my husband likes it he wanted to eat more for lunch i see i will be making these more often,623
20124,43139,4,as ever an gives a result we kim and i gave this a 4 we found the gravy was a little thin next time we this it will be for guests we will add some additional spices to it more flavourful the chicken itself was really tender and moist,233
73630,586022,5,this for an early thanksgiving dinner last week to go with pecan pie bars and pumpkin pie squares i can t believe my parents have never had these before but now it will be a go to for them to take to potlucks texas sheet cake is such a crowd pleaser because your brownie lover s love it and your cake lovers love it too and stays moist and gets better the next day i tweaked the icing and used 6 t buttermilk 5 t cocoa 1 2 c real butter and 4 c powdered sugar and vanilla would be with pecans but left out for those who are not nut lovers i am making again today to take to thanksgiving yum,590
48165,369808,5,i this for thanksgiving this year and everybody loved it it was fantastic i sure will be making it again it had a bit of a sweet flavor but it wasn t overly sweet at all which these kinds of stuffings often can be definetely a keeper,233
118139,118756,5,no question this is a five star everyone raved about this dessert i did not have a vanilla bean so used a teaspoon of very quality vanilla extract and it worked fine i omitted the orange zest but it didn t matter it is and has a wonderful light texture and superb taste,269
128956,2182727,5,10 stars if i could weight watchers or not totally love this soup i 039 v this several times now 1st time went by and it was so i ate the whole thing 4 5 times more and changed it up alittle each time just trying different variations still so very most diffenently be making this over amp over again thanx for this super,320
219357,1677154,5,excellent rolls i like em heavy,31
9071,185113,5,i loved this soup it was and very satisfying i used a pound of dried northern beans and more water and also added some chicken stock for sharing,144
337063,677508,5,enjoyed this very much today i did use regular milk and 2 eggs instead of the egg substitute and regular sour cream as these where the items i had without shopping i thought it might be a tad sweet with the corn muffin mix but i love sweet cornbread so it worked out just for us it did take about 5 minutes longer to cook but different ovens will do that it s so to and with a salad makes a complete meal for sharing,416
51669,69324,4,i loved eating these cookies and bought them all the time now i save money by making my own and it tastes so i store them in the cookie jar that s air tight and they stay fresh for ages,185
12521,1373257,5,so and to i used carrot cake mix added in 2 shredded carrots because who wants carrot flavored pieces when you can have real carrot and a tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice,169
81160,2001614597,2,i m sorry to say this just did not the cut for our family i it exactly as stated and i m not a novice chef i ve been making many fantastic dishes for over ten years this was not one of them this dish is underwhelming at best i feel it important to note that at 16 minutes my taco ring was very dark nearly burnt so keep an eye on it during cooking while not inedible it just was not my three children wouldn t eat it and my husband was very unimpressed and we are not picky eaters we didn t even save the leftovers i think the buttery crescents just an odd combination with the taco meat and didn t go well together plus no one was really sure how to eat it with all the toppings in the end we simply used forks to get bites of all the fixings with the taco ring i definitely will not be making this ever again and i suggest you don t either stick to traditional tacos or quesadillas burritos fajitas or tostadas if you need to change it up anything but this,958
99918,562874,5,my husband and i really liked this we did need a little bit more veggies but overall it turned out excellent with flavor we definitely will be making this dish again,165
183811,146783,5,just want to add to what others have said this omelet is fantastic i love the versatility of it it is quick and is to use up ingredients you have on hand i used spinach mushrooms onion mozzarella and cheddar cheese the only thing i would say is that depending on the amount of ingredients you use this is definitely more than 3 servings you for posting,352
14684,92290,5,this was very very and to i used broccoli slaw instead of the carrots and added chopped garlic to the ricotta mix i too sauteed the mushrooms and zucchini in butter with some red onion and garlic before adding to the lasagna 375 at 45 50 min with some extra sauce on the side for topping yum,291

26958,1159811,5,these were incredible tasted exactly like a samosa i had before at a cafe this is my first samosa i have tried and i m sticking with this one i omitted the dried cilantro and used a handful of fresh instead and used canned sweet peas outstanding this will be a favorite in my house so much for posting this sarafish,315
29750,311353,5,absolutely delightful and very versitile forgiving grilled the pork yum and had to a couple substitutions for the chutney rasp jam and white wine vinegar for rasp vineg and granny smith apples for pears still tremendously delish we loved the little pepper touch to the sweet chutney for the dish,295

155023,694574,5,i just this for dinner and it was so much easier than rolling i didn t have dried shrimp so i placed medium sized shrimp in rows and cut between them to squares i cut up 4 sheets of nori and sprinkled it on top we loved it hint cut the nori up with scissors we used wheat free tamari mixed with wasabi for a dip so this is also gluten free this makes a large amount so next time i will cut it in half,400

70088,576644,5,i m consistently pleased with the ease and efficacy of this the hardest part is grating the bar of fels naptha soap i actually use equal parts laundry soap borax and the result is a very gel that i keep in a 5 gallon covered container,234

136202,240261,4,i haven t tried this yet but it sounds wonderful i would add some frozen okra to thicken it up and maybe some shell on crab several hours into the cook time i can t wait try this,178

392619,2001441880,4,tried this for the first time today and it was however adding milk to the batter killed it for me and i should ve known better that the milk would it watery hence the seasonings didn t stick to the fish very well and i couldn t taste it once it was done i would higly recommend not adding the milk just the egg and the rest of the ingredients is enough i also used crushed saltine crackers since i didn t have breadcrumbs in my pantry and honestly i would use it again as it gave it a light fluffy texture i also had to use chopped almonds since i didn t have sliced ones and it was perfect this was a spur of the moment thing to try so i had to go with what i had in my pantry i m trying to cook eat healthy and substituted jalapeno infused olive oil for butter it definitely added some kick and flavor will be making this again for sure you for sharing this,859

321529,485915,4,very a few changes i used ground beef instead of meatloaf mix and added onions as it browned added a little extra garlic and fat free ricotta quick and and was perfect because it a smaller amount than a pan for sharing,218
15343,140992,4,this is such a i also tossed in some steamed broccoli for sharing,65
205890,435019,4,these are tasting cookies but also a bit on the greasy side i might cut back on the butter if i them again,106
51209,640930,5,i this tonite after a hard daysworkof getting stuff out of the garage to the curb for junk day in our town wonderful skipped the msg the only thing is that unless you want the center doughy you need to bake it loner than 20 minutes,231
193704,449702,5,very i served it with cornbread and hubby and kids loved it i did leave out the olives and browned the beef rather than beans but otherwise stuck to the just kidding i think it was a typo but this is a wonderful for posting,223

28794,205786,5,i did some changes but the basics were the same and i loved the results i wanted to half the and did so with the following exceptions i used 3 egg yolks and 2 whites i omitted the pineapple and juice instead using the juice of one lemon i this in a 6 springform pan which i buttered generously and sprinkled with graham crumbs it took about 1 4 cup to coat the pan bottom and sides i was worried that the pan was going to be too small but it worked perfectly i wrapped the bottom of the pan in foil and set it in a larger pan with water about 3 4 up the sides of the pan i cooked it a 325 f my oven runs a little hot and it took 70 minutes this 6 size servings which i served with a strawberry sauce,699
490345,2683822,5,i this lovely soup this week it tastes even better left over so it ahead to get the richest flavor i think baking the squash as directed makes the squash sweeter soup,166
64355,71298,5,i was going to post this but you beat me to it this is simply one of the best cheesecakes i have ever it s like an apple crisp and cheesecake all in one i it for christmas last year and it didn t last long i find it quite addictive i kept eating little pieces all thru the night,278

102098,605607,5,this makes a cordial i a large batch of it last year and gave bottles of it as holiday presents to people i m making it again this year because it went over so well very similar to chambord liquor i use a blend of raspberries blackberries and blueberries and instead of vodka i used everclear diluted with 2 parts water and 1 part alcohol vodka has a very slight taste and i wanted to avoid having that in the cordial but i m sure it would be just as this is fairly time consuming if you ve ever jelly and extracted juice from fruits you ll be familiar with the process but well worth it in the summertime mixed into iced tea lemon lime soda or any that calls for a liquor like chambord,686
119541,1802772526,2,if a bit bland where i have a problem is wondering how this meal can feed 6 people lt br gt three at the most,109
273777,692757,5,this is a winner a huge hit i did double the jalapeno peppers and mixed 1 1 2 cups of monterrey colby cheese blend into the cream cheese mayo and peppers mixture topped with another cup of the mon colby blend i love cheese and panko breadcrumbs sprayed the breadcrumbs with pam and baked 375 for about 30 minutes and you can use whatever cheese you like best and it taste,371
82939,1803516329,5,omg i was looking for something different to this year and had some very moist and plump dried mission figs so i looked up fig cookies and this is the first one that came up after reading several other recipes on the internet i decided to this one and it is so i am so glad i chose it i had no problem chopping the filling in my fp since everything was moist it chopped up in seconds the dough was a little trickier but also no problem i could not wait to cool the cookies and ice them the aroma was so wonderful i love this and so did my family and friends you,561
51624,1007609,5,i wanted to try a using some kind of alcoholic beverage and this one sounded interesting as i checked the quality and consistency of the rum i had my kids get the other ingredients i mistakenly brought home a 9 pound ham instead of a 3 inch ham steak no problem increase the rum brown sugar cherries and even threw in the cherry juice my pyro son did the lighting of the rum that was really cool the more the rum heated the bigger the flame got thing we had a cathedral ceiling in the kitchen we cooked the ham at a higher temp according to the instructions that came with the ham in water at 350 for 2 hrs covered in foil then we uncovered it took the water out added the rum mix and baked at 300 for 30 more min basting several times wow we used a probe thermometer and when the center got to 160 degrees we took it out that ham fed my wife and i our two kids took some to my parents and put the rest in ziploc bags and froze for future use oh and the ham bone will also an appearance in another t woolfe perhaps next time i may throw some pineapple in the rum mix too,1070
158671,149295,5,this is i 039 m a weight watcher who loves key lime pie and this satisfies that craving beautifully i it as a mousse without the crust and the texture and flavor were i 039 m going to try with other fruit flavors this is a staple to have when you want a refreshing dessert that is low in calories,296
83624,2000450239,1,this was too sour i don 039 t think the vinegar should be in this yuck,70
14457,135547,3,i this with half rhubarb and half strawberries it was pretty but i was not super impressed with it,98
48697,1177285,5,i came here looking specifically for a for banana yogurt muffins and this is what came up in the search i them and we enjoyed them i was intending to give it a four star rating i think five stars should be reserved for something that could not possibly better but i glanced at the this morning and realized i had erred in making it and left out an entire ingredient the fact that the muffins still turned out speaks highly of the five stars it is,446
160413,2002282503,5,they looked and tasted,22
65051,92968,5,these are by far the best bran muffins i ve ever or eaten i let the bran mixture set about 5 minutes before adding the flour but otherwise the exactly as written the end result was as moist sweet muffin that only counts as 2 weight watcher points,246
104354,285094,5,i thought this was we tried 2 low carb pizzas 2 nights in a row although we really liked both my husband preferred the other while i loved this one just goes to show how everyones tastes can differ next time i will add italian seasoning and garlic to boost the flavor we will definately this many more times a bunch,315
491151,2001200073,5,these are will be making them again and again tks,49
20612,52963,5,this is a keeper i reduced the to 1 3 only serving 2 people i used grape tomatoes quartered and shallots instead of the onion it was should have more worked well with chicken souvlaki 40226,189
87782,1331434,1,horrible i followed the exactly and they just didn t have much flavor,69
20917,540142,4,these were i didn t use crisco because of the hydrogenated oils i used smart balance in the cookie and fat free cream cheese in the frosting i also used whole wheat flour i loved how the cookies were soft and chewy,214
223075,1384367,5,this is going to become a regular in our house the husband and i both loved it i was afraid the soy sauce and broth added at the end looked a bit soupy but it was fine my advice have faith in the and cook for the full five minutes everything will be fine for sharing this one,275
47335,268932,5,this was a very i will it again,31
48346,76756,5,i have this twice in a week and it is just the first time i prepared it the chocolate sauce bubbled over a little onto the bottom of my oven but the second time it didn t i may have overcooked it a bit the first time but nevertheless it was will definitely this one over and over,279
35988,58300,5,i came across this this morning i have been home laid up with a broken tailbone bulging disc and some pulled muscles so i was looking for recipes that i can whip up oh my this is so i changed it up a bit i used mini raviolis and a can of italian diced tomatoes the one with the seasonings in it i only need 5 cups of chicken broth i will add this to our list of soups and i will for sure be making this again and again so much for sharing,438
